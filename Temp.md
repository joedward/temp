# Ch 18: Electric Charge and Electric Field

## Introduction

We discussed the fundamental force of gravity during the first semester. This semester will start with a discussion of electromagnetism and the forces of electricity and magnetism. This chapter will discuss situations in which the charges are at rest. When charges move we have an electrical current. This will be covered in a future chapter.

## Terms to Know

  - charge, static electricity, conductor, insulator, polarization, proton, electron
  - field, polar, screening
  - electrostatics, net field, perpendicular

## 18.1. Static Electricity and Charge: Conservation of Charge

### To Do

  - Define electric charge, and describe how the two types of charge interact.
  - Describe three common situations that generate static electricity.
  - State the law of conservation of charge.

### Notes

Don&#39;t try to repeat Franklin&#39;s experiments with kites!

What situations are studied in electrostatics?

List some situations in which you have observed the force of static electricity.

What is electric charge?

How many types of charge exist?

Do charges create any other force other than attractive or repulsive?

We will see some demonstrations of force on charged objects in class. A charged rubber rod will have a net negative charge. A charged glass rod will have a net positive charge. In the 1700&#39;s the terms positive and negative were selected by scientists (especially Franklin). The terms positive and negative could have been chosen differently, which would have caused all the references to positive and negative to be reversed in all the textbooks written since the 1700&#39;s. The point is that we cannot see some label on the charged objects that tells us it is positive or negative. These terms are assigned as part of the scientific method of making observations and classifying objects before making a hypothesis that explains the observation.

Ask me to explain Franklin&#39;s view of electricity if I forget to explain it in class

If the amount of charge is fixed, what will cause the electric force to be weaker?

It was not until the early 1900&#39;s that scientists came to understand that objects are made of atoms and that the atoms have protons (+) and electrons (-).

Know the basic structure of the atom: proton, neutron, electron;  small, dense, nuclear model.

What is the fundamental unit of charge?

Think about these questions: 1) who determined the amount of charge on the electron, 2) when was it determined, 3) where did this person attend high school?

Would you say that the Coulomb represents a large amount of charge?

Know the principle of   &quot;conservation of charge.&quot;

## 18.2 Conductors and Insulators

### To Do

  - Define conductor and insulator, explain the difference, and give examples of each.
  - Describe three methods for charging an object.
  - Explain what happens to an electric force as you move farther from the source.
  - Define polarization.

### Notes

Why does a metal conduct electricity?

Why does an insulator not conduct electricity?

How does an electroscope detect the presence of net charge?

Know the principles of charging by friction, contact and induction.

## 18.3 Coulomb&#39;s Law

### To Do

  - State Coulomb&#39;s law in terms of how the electrostatic force changes with the distance between two objects.
  - Calculate the electrostatic force between two charged point forces, such as electrons or protons.
  - Compare the electrostatic force to the gravitational attraction for a proton and an electron; for a human and the Earth.

### Notes

How was the dependence of Force on amount of charge and distance between the objects determined?   Who determined it?

                        kq1q2

Coulomb&#39;s law  F = ----------               k = 9 x 109          Know how to add force vectors.

                        r2

Compare the mathematical form of Coulomb&#39;s Law to Newton&#39;s Universal Law of Gravitation.

Would you say that gravity or the electrical force is more important in calculating the acceleration of a proton and electron that are near each other?   (F = ma)

Why did we bother discussing the force of gravity during the first semester if gravity is so weak compared to the electrical force?

We may work example problems using Coulomb&#39;s Law.

## 18.4. Electric Field: Concept of a Field Revisited

### To Do

  - Describe a force field and calculate the strength of an electric field due to a point charge.
  - Calculate the force exerted on a test charge by an electric field.
  - Explain the relationship between electrical force (F) on a test charge and electrical field strength (E).

### Notes

You may recall that we calculated weight during the first semester using W = mg.

The acceleration due to gravity, g, is being used as a field in this calculation. Sometimes, we will calculate electric force using the concept of an electric field. g is not quite as interesting as the electric field as g always pointed towards the center of the Earth. The electric field will have more variety to its direction.

A test charge is a very small charge that does not disturb any other existing charges in the situation. If you divide the observed electric force by the value of a test charge at a point in space you will have found the electric field. The magnitude of the field (Newtons/Coulomb) is given by the division of the numbers. The direction of the field is the direction of the force, assuming your test charge carries positive charge. The direction of the field is 180 degrees different if the test charge is negative.

                                                        kq
    
        Electric Field   E =   F/qo        OR   E = -------               Force = q \* E    (vectors)
    
                                                                r2

We may do some sample calculations of the electric field and electric force.

Know how to draw electric field lines and know what they signify (magnitude of E and direction).

## 18.5 Electric Field Lines: Multiple Charges

### To Do

  - Calculate the total force (magnitude and direction) exerted on a test charge from more than one charge
  - Describe an electric field diagram of a positive point charge; of a negative point charge with twice the magnitude of positive charge
  - Draw the electric field lines between two points of the same charge; between two points of opposite charge.

### Notes

What questions do you have on the sketch of electric field lines for a single charge?

Do you agree that the spacing of the lines is an indicator of the magnitude of the electric field?

The electric field is a vector. When there is more than one charge present you will have to find the net electric field by performing vector addition E fields using the component method.

We will also do vector addition with electric force vectors.

You should memorize the rules for electric fields that are given after Figure 18.26.

I would recommend that you run the PhET electric field simulation.

Drag positive and negative charges onto the screen. Drag an electric field detector around the screen. Click on some of the boxes.

## 18.6 Electric Forces in Biology

### To Do

  - Describe how a water molecule is polar.
  - Explain electrostatic screening by a water molecule within a living cell.

### Notes

You should read through this section to increase your appreciation for the role electrical forces play in Biology.

The term screening will come up again when we study the atom. Suppose three protons are located at the origin of a coordinate system. Suppose two electrons are located at location X = 2 meters. Suppose a third electron is located at X = 3 meters. The three protons will be partially screened by the two electrons such that the electron at X = 3 meters will essentially experience force from one proton. The details are a little more complicated than this, but the term screening refers to a partial reduction in the electric effect due to intervening charges.

Water is a polar molecule. The charges are not uniformly distributed in the water molecule. One end of the molecule is more negative that the other end of the molecule. If I remember I will illustrate this in class.

## 18.7 Conductors and Electric Fields in Static Equilibrium

### To Do

  - List the three properties of a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium.
  - Explain the effect of an electric field on free charges in a conductor.
  - Explain why no electric field may exist inside a conductor.
  - Describe the electric field surrounding Earth.
  - Explain what happens to an electric field applied to an irregular conductor.
  - Describe how a lightning rod works.
  - Explain how a metal car may protect passengers inside from the dangerous electric fields caused by a downed line touching the car.

### Notes

Conductors roughly have one free electron for each atom in the conductor. There is an extremely large number of electrons that can move in a typical conductor. These electrons (and any additional electrons added to the conductor) quickly ( less than a billionth of a second) move to establish static equilibrium if they are ever out of equilibrium. After this short time the charges are not moving and are not accelerating.

What is true about the net force on an object that is not accelerating?

For a conductor in static electricity, why does the component of the electric field that is parallel to the conductor have a value of 0 N/C?

For the case of electrostatics, when a neutral conductor is placed in an external electric field, the charges in the conductor move briefly to an arrangement such that the electric field inside the conductor is zero. This has been known since the late 1700&#39;s. In Figure 18.31 imagine the electric field before the conductor is inserted into the electric field. The electric field lines would be parallel lines directed to the right. Imagine the instant in time when the conductor is inserted. The electric field lines would be parallel lines in the conductor. How do the charges have to move in the conductor to produce a net electric field of zero?  To produce a zero net electric field a second electric field directed to the left needs to be in place. This accomplished by electrons in the conductor moving to the left. The second electric field due to charge separation (polarization) in the conductor will cancel the original electric field inside the conductor. Ask me in class if this explanation is not clear.

Note that excess charge will reside on the surface of a conductor for the case of static electricity. This has been confirmed experimentally. The excess charges repel each other. The charges can move in a conductor. The charges move to the surface around the object to establish equilibrium.

From the previous discussion you should be able to answer these questions.

1. What is true concerning the value of the electric field inside a conductor (for electrostatics)?

2. Where does excess charge reside on a metal object (for electrostatics)?

3. How is an electric field line drawn at the surface of a conductor (for electrostatics)?

For a single charge the electric field lines diverge from the location of the charge. Figure 18.33 shows how a uniform electric field can be produced. We will ignore the curved field lines at the left and right edge of the sketch. Describe how the sketch indicates that the electric field is uniform between the two lines of charge.

Sunlight can ionize atoms at the top of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Some of the electrons from these atoms can escape into space. What is the net charge of the ionosphere?

The Earth is a conductor. Electrons in the Earth can migrate to the surface of the Earth to try to get nearer to the ionosphere. Does this lead to an electric field (150 N/C)  in the atmosphere of the Earth?

Large air currents in thunderstorms can cause a separation of charge. When the electric field gets large enough (3 x 106 N/C) the atoms in the atmosphere ionize and lightning occurs.

You should know that the strongest electric field occurs at the sharp points of a conductor. A lightning rod is not used to draw a lightning bolt, but rather to reduce the net charge in the vicinity of the building to reduce the electric field and make a lightning strike less likely.

Describe the excess charges and electric field in a Faraday cage.

## 18.8 Applications of Electrostatics

### To Do

  - ?

### Notes

Van de Graaff Generator

This device has a large smooth conductor at the top. An insulating belt has electrons removed at the bottom. The belt removes electrons at the top of the device. A large positive charge is developed on the top dome of the device. We will learn in a future chapter that this develops a large potential (voltage) on the top dome. Positive ions released near this dome can be accelerated as their potential energy near the dome changes to kinetic energy.

You should read through the other examples of electrostatics (photocopier, laser printer, pollution control) in this section.

# Ch 19: Electric Potential and Electric Energy

## Introduction

Electrical problems can be solved using energy concepts instead of vectors. This concept (Potential Energy and Kinetic Energy) was used during the first semester of this course and will be used again now.

You will have to read carefully in this chapter. The terms &quot;potential,&quot; &quot;potential difference,&quot; and &quot;potential energy&quot; refer to different concepts.

## Terms to Know

  - electric potential, electric potential energy, electron volt, voltage, equipotential
  - voltage, capacitor, dielectric, series, parallel

## 19.1 Electric Potential Energy: Potential Difference

### To Do

  - Define electric potential and electric potential energy.
  - Describe the relationship between potential difference and electrical potential energy.
  - Explain electron volt and its usage in submicroscopic process.
  - Determine electric potential energy given potential difference and amount of charge.

### Notes

A positive charge that is located near a group of fixed positive charges will move and gain kinetic energy. There is a similarity between motion in electric fields and motion due to gravity. Both the gravitational force and the electric force are conservative (they both have an associated potential energy).

Work is required to move a positive charge (charge 1) from a location near negative charges  towards a (fixed) positive charge (charge 2). The work done on charge 1 gives charge 1 potential energy. If charge 1 is released it will move away from charge 2 and will gain Kinetic Energy. When a positive charge is in a region of other positive charges it is similar to a mass being up above the surface of the Earth. When the mass is released it will move towards the ground. When the positive charge is released it will move away from the other positive charges.

Definition of Electric Potential

Important…Electric Potential is not the same as Potential Energy. You can have an electric potential with just one charge. Electric potential energy requires at least two charges.

PEA / q  = VA       VA is the electric potential at location A         1 Joule/ 1 Coulomb = 1 Volt

The work required to move a positive charge from location B towards location A is calculated using

WBA = q \* VBA       VBA   is the potential difference between locations A and B

Or,    VBA   = Change in PE / q        Or, change in PE = q \* VBA

VBA   =  VB    - VA    Potential difference can be called &quot;voltage.&quot;

Q1  Does the location where V = 0 make a difference in solving problems?

Know the difference between electric potential and potential energy.

What questions do you have on the examples worked in the textbook?

What is the relation of  battery terminals and  potential difference?

How is the electron volt (eV) defined?

Why is it used?

Is it a unit of energy or power or potential, etc.?

Conservation of Energy

KEi + PEi= KEf + PEf

In a typical problem the initial KE = 0 and the final PE = 0. The initial PE = qV and KE = ½ m v2

## 19.2 Electric Potential in a Uniform Electric Field

### To Do

  - Describe the relationship between voltage and electric field.
  - Derive an expression for the electric potential and electric field.
  - Calculate electric field strength given distance and voltage.

### Notes

If the electric field is uniform (constant) then VBA  = Ed     or,       E = VBA / d

Where d is the distance between points A and B.

VBA is often just replaced with ΔV. ΔV is the electric potential between two locations.

In the uniform field you can also calculate Work    W = q ΔV   and Force   F = qE.

## 19.3 Electrical Potential Due to a Point Charge

### To Do

  - Explain point charges and express the equation for electric potential of a point charge.
  - Distinguish between electric potential and electric field.
  - Determine the electric potential of a point charge given charge and distance.

### Notes

As our textbook points out, Calculus can be used to derive the expression for the potential at some distance, r, from a point charge. V = k q / r  . V here is the potential at one location, not the potential difference. Note that V is positive when q is positive and V is negative when q is negative.

Note that V is a scalar, not a vector. This tends to make problems easier to solve than when E is used.

As r increases V decreases. Q2  What is the value of V when the point of interest is an infinite distance away from q?

To find V due to more than one point charge you simply add the separate V&#39;s. This is simpler than adding E&#39;s because you don&#39;t have to use components to add V&#39;s.

     kq1q2

PE =   ---------        Two charges have an associated value of potential energy.

         r

## 19.4 Equipotential Lines

### To Do

  - Explain equipotential lines and equipotential surfaces.
  - Describe the action of grounding an electrical appliance.
  - Compare electric field and equipotential lines.

### Notes

What are equipotential lines and surfaces?

Do lines of equipotential stop or start on a charged object?

Q3 What is the shape of an equipotential line around a point charge?

When and why do we say that the surface of a conductor is an equipotential surface?

Know the relation (orientation) of electric field lines to lines of equal electric potential.

Why is the work equal to zero when a charge is moved along an equipotential?

Grounding refers to the process of having a conducting path to the Earth. The third connector on a modern electrical plug is the ground. The metal case of an appliance is connected to the ground as a safety mechanism.

You should be familiar with the sketches of E and equipotentials shown in the text.

ANSWERS  …………….

Q1   No, only the difference in voltage is important in solving problems. A single voltage does not help you solve a problem.

Q2    V is equal to zero when the point of interest is infinitely far from the charge.

Q3   The equipotential is a circle. Every point o n the circle has the same value for r and thus the same value for V.

For electric circuits that do not use computer chips there are five main elements. 1) a source of potential difference (e.g. battery), 2) wires to provide a conducting path for electrons, 3) resistors to limit the size of the flow of electrons, 4) capacitors to store charge and energy, 5) inductors to store energy and moderate the flow of electrons. We will cover capacitors in this section. Batteries, wires, and resistors will be discussed in the next chapter. Inductors will be discussed briefly when we discuss alternating current circuits and magnetism.

## 19.5 Capacitors and Dielectrics

### To Do

  - Describe the action of a capacitor and define capacitance.
  - Explain parallel plate capacitors and their capacitances.
  - Discuss the process of increasing the capacitance of a dielectric.
  - Determine capacitance given charge and voltage.

### Notes

A parallel plate capacitor has two metal plates facing each other at a close distance. When wires connect the plates of a capacitor to a battery electrons will move from one plate towards the positive terminal of the battery. Electrons will move from the negative terminal of the battery towards the other plate. There is an insulator (air or some material) between the plates of the capacitor.

Why is it reasonable that there is +Q on one plate and –Q on the other plate?  (i.e. why is the magnitude of charge the same on each plate?)

The amount of charge stored on a capacitor is related the potential difference across the plates of the capacitor. Why is it reasonable that the charge on the plates is proportional to the potential difference?

Q = CV     The capacitance value, C, is the constant of proportionality that changes the proportion between Q and V into an equation. C is the value of capacitance in Farads. C can be calculated from the geometry of a parallel plate capacitor using  C =  o A / d  . A is area in m2, d is distance between the plates in meters. o is a constant, the &quot;permittivity of free space&quot; and has a value of 8.85 x 10-12 in standard metric units.

You will need to be careful in reading this chapter. When C is used in an equation it represents the capacitance value in units of Farads. But you will see C used to denote the value of charge in Coulombs.

Try to do this calculation:  Suppose a parallel plate capacitor is made with two aluminum plates facing each other with 1 millimeter of air between the plates. The value of the capacitance is 1 Farad. If the plates are square what is the length of one edge of one of the square plates?

Q1. Does the capacitance value change as the voltage applied to the capacitor changes?

Be able to sketch the electric field in the vicinity of a parallel plate capacitor.

DIELECTRIC

When the dielectric is placed between the plates of the capacitor, it polarizes when the capacitor is charged. You should draw a parallel plate capacitor. Let the capacitor be charged and then disconnected from the battery. Draw dielectric between the plates and show the charged sides of the dielectric. (This drawing is in the OpenStax textbook.) The electric field created by the polarized dielectric partially cancels the electric field created by the charge on the plates of the capacitor. Recall Q = CV and E = V/d.

Since the net electric field is less the potential difference, V, between the plates is less. Q is constant when the capacitor is disconnected from the battery so C must be a larger number.

A dielectric, which is inserted between the plates of a capacitor, changes the capacitance value.

       C = k o A/d        k is the dielectric constant.

Q2. Why is the dielectric strength an important characteristic of a dielectric?

## 19.6 Capacitors in Series and Parallel

### To Do

  - Derive expressions for total capacitance in series and in parallel.
  - Identify series and parallel parts in the combination of connection of capacitors.
  - Calculate the effective capacitance in series and parallel given individual capacitances.

### Notes

You should learn to recognize when capacitors are connected in series and when they are connected in parallel. In the series arrangement the +Q plate of one capacitor is connected to the –Q plate of the next capacitor in a line. The potential differences of all of the capacitors add up to the potential difference of the battery (if there are no other capacitors, resistors, or inductors in the circuit). The series arrangement of capacitors can be replaced with one equivalent capacitor. The value of the equivalent capacitor is

1/CS =   1/C1  +1/C2  +1/C3  …

The value of the capacitor that is equivalent to the series arrangement is ALWAYS smaller than the smallest capacitor in the series. The value of the series arrangement is that the voltage across each capacitor is smaller than the battery voltage so the dielectric is in less danger of breaking down.

Capacitors are connected in parallel when all of the +Q plates are wired together and all of the –Q plates are wired together. The potential difference across each capacitor is the same value and is equal to the potential difference of the battery (if there are no other capacitors, resistors, or inductors in the circuit). The value of a single capacitor that is equivalent to the parallel capacitors is

CP =  C1 + C2 + C3   …

The advantage of the parallel arrangement is that larger values of capacitance can be produced.

You will have to learn how to simplify circuits that have combinations of series and parallel capacitors. You will need to work one step at a time, finding either the equivalent capacitance for a series arrangement or an equivalent capacitance for a parallel arrangement.

## 19.7 Energy Stored in Capacitors

### To Do

  - List some uses of capacitors.
  - Express in equation form the energy stored in a capacitor.
  - Explain the function of a defibrillator.

### Notes

When a capacitor has zero charge on its plate it is relatively easy for the battery to move one electron away from the +Q plate and deliver one electron to the –Q plate. To move the second electron more work (energy is required). To move the third electron even more energy is required. When the capacitor is fully charged the plates of the capacitor will have the same potential difference as the potential difference of the battery. With the potential of the +Q plate equal to the potential of the positive terminal of the battery there is no motivation for an electron to leave the +Q plate. Etc. for the –Q plate and the negative terminal of the battery. The battery has done work on the charges to create the charge arrangement of the capacitor.

The energy stored in a capacitor is calculated using             Energy = 0.5CV2

I will not use E to represent energy as there is too much danger that you might assume the E represents the value of the electric field. Through the use of substitutions (Q=CV) you can modify the energy equation to suit the data in hand and calculate the energy stored in the capacitor.

How does a defibrillator use a capacitor?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. No. The capacitance value only depends on the geometry of the capacitor and what type of material (dielectric) is between the plates of the capacitor. It is the charge on the plates that changes when the potential difference changes, not the capacitance value.

Q2. If the voltage across the plates (potential difference) is too high the electric field will be too high and the dielectric will break down and become a conductor. This is a dangerous situation for a capacitor as the electrons on the –Q plate will move through the dielectric to the +Q plate in a short time. The capacitor may explode due to the sudden release of energy.

# Ch 20: Electric Current, Resistance, and Ohm&#39;s Law

## Introduction

For electric circuits that do not use computer chips there are five main elements. 1) a source of potential difference (e.g. battery), 2) wires to provide a conducting path for electrons, 3) resistors to limit the size of the flow of electrons, 4) capacitors to store charge and energy, 5) inductors to store energy and moderate the flow of electrons.

Electricity is a tool that drives much of our technology. Electric circuits provide the means for delivering a controlled amount of energy to a destination. Take a moment to make a mental list of all the electrical devices you use on a daily basis that you would miss if they did not exist.

## Terms to Know

  - current, conventional current, drift velocity, resistance, resistivity, power, energy
  - power, Joule heating, direct current, alternating current, rms, short circuit

## 20.1 Current

### To Do

  - Define electric current, ampere, and drift velocity
  - Describe the direction of charge flow in conventional current.
  - Use drift velocity to calculate current and vice versa.

### Notes

We have now left the realm of static electricity. When a potential difference exists in a conductor there will be motion of charge (electrons for the case of a solid). We will not discuss current in liquids and gases where the positive ions could contribute to the current value. The current (Amperes) is defined as the quantity of charge in Coulombs that passes one point in one second.

To calculate current you will use    I = Q/t       I is the current in Amperes, Q is the charge in Coulombs and t is the time in seconds.

Schematic diagrams show the key components and wires in a circuit. You should memorize the symbols used in schematic diagrams.

We will follow the 200+ years of tradition and label the current in the circuit as if positive charge was moving in the wire. This is known as the conventional current. The assumption that + charges move in a solid is a continuation of Franklin&#39;s model for electric charge. For most situations the analysis of the circuit and its effects does not depend on whether + or – charge is moving in the circuit.

Since each atom in the conductor has one or two &quot;free&quot; (easily shared) electrons, and objects have tremendous numbers of atoms, there are tremendous numbers of electrons available to move in an object. We don&#39;t see the discrete nature of electric current (single charges moving) due to the small size and great numbers of electrons in a conductor.

Drift Velocity

TRUE or FALSE  A typical wire used in buildings or houses is a hollow cylinder which allows electrons to freely move from the – potential to the + potential of the circuit.

When a potential difference is established between the ends of a conductor an electric field is established in the conductor. Recall E = V/d    This electric field propagates (is established) throughout the conductor at about the speed of light. The electric field accelerates the electrons and they pick up speed. The moving electrons quickly hit atoms in the wire and bounce back but the electric field restores their velocity until another collision occurs. The electrons to not accelerate to a high speed. The electrons deliver KE to the atoms in the wire and wire temperature increases. Have you ever felt the temperature of a wire connected to a lamp?  The electrons actually make slow progress through the wire. The typical velocity of the electrons in a conductor is 1 x 10-4 m/s. This is known as the drift velocity.

Q1. Suppose that a lightbulb is 6 centimeters away from the switch on a flashlight. Calculate the length of time required for an electron to move from the switch to the lightbulb. Why does the flashlight go on almost immediately?

I = nqAvd  . n is the density of charge carriers, q is the charge on an electron, A is the cross-sectional area, and vd is the drift velocity.

## 20.2 Ohm&#39;s Law: Resistance and Simple Circuits

### To Do

  - Explain the origin of Ohm&#39;s law.
  - Calculate voltages, currents, or resistances with Ohm&#39;s law.
  - Explain what an ohmic material is.
  - Describe a simple circuit.

### Notes

A battery produces potential difference due to chemical reactions inside the battery. We will not discuss those reactions. The battery maintains a (relatively) constant potential difference until the chemical energy is depleted.

It was observed in the 1800&#39;s that the current in a circuit is proportional to the voltage applied to the circuit. (Voltage applied = potential difference.)  The constant of proportionality is the resistance, R, of the circuit. V = I R      Ohm&#39;s Law

Conductors in which I is linearly proportional to V are called ohmic materials. Ordinary wires are ohmic if the temperature of the wire is relatively constant. Examples of non-ohmic materials are light bulb filaments (large temperature change), transistors, computer chips, etc.). In a non-ohmic material the resistance changes as the current changes.

The schematic symbol for a battery is a set of parallel lines in which the longer line is the + terminal. The symbol for a resistor is a pointed-squiggly line.

We will trace around electric circuits starting from the + terminal of the battery. We will label the – terminal of the battery with 0 volts. So, if we start at the + terminal of a 9 volt battery we have to lose 9 volts someplace in the circuit to reach 0 volts at the – terminal. We will treat the wires as ideal ( 0 resistance) for most problems that have other finite resistors in the circuit. The 9 volts of potential will be lost in the resistor. The &quot;voltage drop&quot; across the resistor (and other circuit elements) can be calculated with V = I R   where I is the current in the resistor and R is the value of the resistor.

The water pipe analogy is OK but lacks the complete circuit effect that is present for electrical circuits. When you use a garden hose the water does not go back to the water supply directly in a pipe.

The PhET simulation on Ohm&#39;s Law will give you a quick feel for the relationship of V, I, and R.

## 20.3 Resistance and Resistivity

### To Do

  - Explain the concept of resistivity.
  - Use resistivity to calculate the resistance of specified configurations of material.
  - Use the thermal coefficient of resistivity to calculate the change of resistance with temperature.

### Notes

You should read and understand the factors that affect the resistance of a conductor.

You can calculate the  resistance of a wire using  R =  (ρ  L) / A

ρ is the resistivity. This is a property of the type of conductor (gold, silver, copper, carbon, etc. ) (and its temperature). L is the length in meters. A is the cross-sectional area in m2 .

Why is silicon known as a semiconductor?

ρ = ρ0(1 + αΔT)      α is a coefficient that is different for different materials. It has typical values of about 3 x 10-3. ΔT is the change in temperature in units of Celsius.

What is the approximate change in temperature needed to double the resistivity for a typical conductor?

Q2. Does resistivity usually increase or decrease as the temperature of the material increases?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Distance = rate \* time     time = distance/rate    t = .06m / 1 x 10-4 m/s  t = 600 seconds

Or  t = 10 minutes!   You don&#39;t have to wait 10 minutes for a flashlight to turn on because the electric field is established very quickly and there is an electron right next to the light bulb filament that is ready to do work on the filament to increase it&#39;s temperature. Also, the filament has low thermal inertia so it does not take long to reach the temperature at which it emits visible light.

Q2. For conductors the resistance increases as the temperature increases. The resistance of a light bulb is larger when it is on than when it is off.

## 20.4 Electric Power and Energy

### To Do

  - Calculate the power dissipated by a resistor and power supplied by a power supply.
  - Calculate the cost of electricity under various circumstances.

### Notes

Recall from first semester that Power = Work / Time  . We can calculate a power rating for an element in an electrical circuit using   Power = I V   where P is the power (in Watts),  I is the current (in amps) in the element and V is the potential difference (in volts) across the element. You should understand how the textbook derives the P=IV relationship. This relationship is reasonable. If I is higher than there are more electrons per second moving past a point in the element and more collisions are occurring. If V is higher than the electrons will be in a region of higher potential difference, higher E, and they will have higher KE when they collide with atoms in the element.

If the material is ohmic we can substitute V = IR  to produce P = I2R  .

&quot;Joule heating&quot; refers to the process of raising the temperature of a conductor by passing an electric current through the conductor. The power deposited in the conductor multiplied by time is equal to the energy deposited in the conductor. From first semester we know   energy = mass \* specific heat \* change in temperature. In some situations Joule heating is desired: toaster, electric blanket, etc. In some situations Joule heating is a danger: extension cord, household wiring, etc.

The Cost of Electricity

Power = Energy / time   so Energy = Power \* time

Utilities charge for the energy delivered to a home or business. Utilities tell customers how much energy they consumed by reporting the kilowatt-hours (kWh) consumed. The cost of electricity varies from state to state. A typical value is around 10 cents/kWh.

Q1. Why is there a push to switch from incandescent bulbs to fluorescent or LED lights?

## 20.5 Alternating Current versus Direct Current

### To Do

  - Explain the differences and similarities between AC and DC current.
  - Calculate rms voltage, current, and average power.
  - Explain why AC current is used for power transmission.

### Notes

Direct current (DC) is current in which the electrons only move in one direction.

Alternating current (AC) is current in which the electrons alternate the direction of motion.

Q2. Why would electrons alternate their direction of motion in a wire?

V = V0 sin(2π ft)        I = I0 sin(2π ft)    f is the frequency and V0  and  I0 are the peak values.

We can still use V = I R at any instant of time.

To compare DC and AC circuits it is common to use the root-mean-square (rms) values for the AC circuit. Irms = I0 / sqrt(2)       Vrms = V0 / sqrt(2)

The average power in the AC circuit is Pave = Irms   Vrms    and   Vrms = Irms R

Why Use AC for Power Distribution?

There was a major competition between Edison (favored DC) and Tesla (favored AC) when electrical power became available to consumers at the end of the 1800&#39;s.

Q3, TRUE or FALSE  Joule heating of long distance ( \&gt; 100 miles) transmission lines is undesirable.

Joule heating depends on the square of the current. ( P = I2R )   The power delivered P = I V. There is an easy way (discussed in a future chapter) of changing V for AC electricity. AC electricity is used for our power grid because the Joule heating is smaller than the Joule heating for a DC power grid.

## 20.6 Electric Hazards and the Human Body

### To Do

  - Define thermal hazard, shock hazard, and short circuit.

### Notes

You should be aware that overheated wires can start a fire.

Why are fuses or circuit breakers used in homes?

You should be aware that electrical currents in the body can disrupt muscle action and heartbeats.

How can you avoid receiving an electrical shock?

In a short circuit the resistance of the circuit is near 0. The current value becomes large. And the Joule heating becomes large.

## 20.7 Nerve Conduction–Electrocardiograms

### Notes

You should read this section if you have a health related career field.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Incandescent bulbs have hot wires inside. Most of the electrical energy goes to the infrared portion of the spectrum. Only 2% of the energy becomes visible light. Fluorescent bulbs convert about 20% of the electrical energy into visible light. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent\_lighting#Luminous\_efficacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_lighting#Luminous_efficacy)).

Q2. When the potential difference across the wire reverses, the electric field reverses direction and the velocity of the electrons reverses direction. In the USA this happens 60 times a second for our electrical power. Our electrical power is known as &quot;60 cycle&quot; power.

Q3. True    Joule heating is waste heat. The wires heat up but no useful work is done for the consumer. The energy used to heat the transmission wires is wasted.

# Ch 21: Circuits and DC Instruments

## Terms to Know

  - series, parallel, voltage drop, EMF, terminal voltage, solar cell
  - junction, potential difference, system of equations, galvanometer, ammeter, voltmeter
  - null, potentiometer, Wheatstone Bridge, time constant, RC circuit

## 21.1 Resistors in Series and Parallel

### To Do

  - Draw a circuit with resistors in parallel and in series.
  - Calculate the voltage drop of a current across a resistor using Ohm&#39;s law.
  - Contrast the way total resistance is calculated for resistors in series and in parallel.
  - Explain why total resistance of a parallel circuit is less than the smallest resistance of any of the resistors in that circuit.
  - Calculate total resistance of a circuit that contains a mixture of resistors connected in series and in parallel.

### Notes

Resistors in Series

Resistors are connected in series if each resistor has the same current. You will see the resistors drawn end to end in the schematic.

net series resistance     RS = R1 + R2 + R3 + ...

What questions do you have on how the textbook derived the equation for net series resistance?

Q1. TRUE or FALSE  If two resistors are connected in series, the net resistance will always be larger than the largest of the individual resistance values.

Q2. TRUE or FALSE  Each resistor in a series arrangement will have a potential difference equal to the potential difference of the battery in the circuit.

How do you calculate the potential difference for each of the resistors that are in series?

How do you calculate the power in each of the resistors that are in series?

How do you calculate the power for the battery in a circuit?

Resistors in Parallel

How can you recognize in a circuit that the elements are connected in parallel?  Think about the possible path(s) for electrons in the circuit.

Resistors connected in parallel have the same potential difference for each resistor.

net  parallel resistance

   1           1         1         1

-----   =  ----- + ----- + -----

  RP           R1       R2       R3

What questions do you have on how the textbook derived the equation for net parallel resistance?

Q3. TRUE or FALSE  If two resistors are connected in parallel, the net resistance will always be smaller than when the same two resistors are connected in series.

How do you calculate the potential difference for each of the resistors that are in parallel?

How do you calculate the power in each of the resistors that are in parallel?

Combinations of Series and Parallel

You must learn to recognize which resistors are in a simple series arrangement and which are in a simple parallel arrangement. You will simplify the circuit one step at a time using the rules to calculate net series and net parallel resistance. I highly recommend that you draw a new circuit diagram every time you do a calculation of a net series or parallel resistance value.

After you simplify the circuit to just the battery and one equivalent resistance, you will start retracing your steps to solve for the individual I and V values for the resistors.

Christmas Tree Lights

Q5. Your Christmas tree is dark because one of the bulbs burned out. Are the lights connected in series or parallel?

SAFETY

Why is it a bad idea to plug in a power strip with 6 outlets into an extension cord?

Do You Remember Seeing This?

When a refrigerator motor starts you may see the light bulb in the kitchen dim briefly. Real wires have some resistance, not 0 ohms. There will be a voltage drop ( V = IR) across the wires for the electrical circuit for the kitchen. When the refrigerator motor starts it has low resistance and draws a large current. This increased current causes an increase in the voltage drop in the wiring to the kitchen light bulb. With less voltage applied to the light bulb it dims. (In a future chapter you will learn why the light bulb gets bright again in a short time.)

How is a voltage divider constructed?  Where have you recently used a voltage divider?

## 21.2 Electromotive Force: Terminal Voltage

### To Do

  - Describe what happens to the terminal voltage, current, and power delivered to a load as internal resistance of the voltage source increases (due to aging of batteries, for example).
  - Explain why it is beneficial to use more than one voltage source connected in parallel.
  - \*. Understand how solar cells are connected to produce the desired electrical current and voltage
  - Explain why batteries in a flashlight gradually lose power and the light dims over time.

### Notes

This chapter will introduce more realistic circuits.

Why is the word &quot;force&quot; misleading?

TRUE or FALSE   The units of EMF are Newtons.

The EMF value is produced by a chemical reaction in an ordinary battery. The battery has resistance inside the battery. What would be a good name for this resistance?

Why is the value of the internal resistance, r, of a battery important?

Vterminal = EMF – Ir

Why is the internal resistance treated as a series resistance and not a parallel resistor to the external resistor that is in the circuit?

Imagine that you select two AA batteries from a drawer in your home and put them into a flashlight. The flashlight only shines dimly. You happen to have an electronic voltmeter in the drawer an you measure 1.5 volts for each of the two batteries. Why is measuring the battery with a voltmeter not a good test to see if the battery will work well in a flashlight?  You need to consider the equation above to answer this question. Or, answer this question:  Why does a battery loose its ability to deliver significant current to a circuit?

Multiple Voltage Sources

Batteries are connected in series to produce a higher terminal voltage.

Batteries are connected in parallel to increase the lifetime of the batteries.

Solar Cell Arrays

You should know why solar cells are connected in series or in parallel.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. True    The electrons must travel through a longer resisting path so the resistance value is greater.

Q2. False   The sum of all of the potential differences across the individual resistors will equal the potential difference of the battery.

Q3. True   There is effectively more area for the electrons to move through so the resistance is less.

Q4. False  Only if all resistors have the same value will the current be the same in each resistor. The smallest R will have the largest current.

Q5. Series   When one of the bulbs burns out it breaks the circuit. Without a complete circuit electrons do not move into the other bulbs.

## 21.3 Kirchhoff&#39;s Rules

### To Do

  - Analyze a complex circuit using Kirchhoff&#39;s rules, using the conventions for determining the correct signs of various terms.

### Notes

Some circuits are too complicated to be simplified with series and parallel combinations.

For these circuits we will solve them by using Kirchhoff&#39;s Rules for circuits. The typical problems we will face will have three branches to the circuits. There will be three unknown currents, one in each branch of the circuit. Kirchhoff&#39;s Rules will let you create three equations for the three unknowns. You will then use algebra methods to solve this system of equations.

Rule 1 … The sum of the currents at any junction must be zero. You will label the conventional current on each section of the circuit. Currents will start at a junction and end at the next junction. Each section of the circuit will have a labeled current. You do not have to be correct in the direction of the current. We will call a current that enters the junction positive. We will call a current that leaves a junction negative.

Rule 2 … The sum of the potential changes around any closed loop of the circuit must be zero. We will pick any point on the loop as the starting point. We will move in one direction around the loop until we get back to the starting point. As we move around a loop, if we move from the negative pole of a batteryto a positive pole that will be a positive change in potential. If we move through a resistor in the direction of the labeled conventional current in the circuit that will be a negative change in potential (a potential drop). If we move through a resistor in the opposite direction to the labeled current that will be a positive change in potential.

What questions do you have on the example worked out in the textbook?

## 21.4 DC Voltmeters and Ammeters

### To Do

  - Explain why a voltmeter must be connected in parallel with the circuit.
  - Draw a diagram showing an ammeter correctly connected in a circuit.
  - Describe how a galvanometer can be used as either a voltmeter or an ammeter.
  - Explain why measuring the voltage or current in a circuit can never be exact.

### Notes

Voltmeters measure potential difference (volts) between two points in a circuit.

Ammeters measure current (amps or milliamps, etc.) in a branch of a circuit.

Voltmeters have high resistance ( \&gt; 106 ohms for electronic voltmeters). Voltmeters should only be placed in parallel with the circuit element for which you want to know the potential difference.

Ammeters have low resistance ( \&lt; 1 ohm typically). Ammeters should only be placed in series with the circuit element for which you want to know the current.

An ideal meter will not disturb the behavior (I, V) of the circuit.

Q1. Why would using a voltmeter in series disturb the behavior of a circuit?

Q2. Why would using an ammeter in parallel disturb the behavior of a circuit?

Analog Meters: Galvanometers

A galvanometer measures small currents.

Electrical meters in use today are digital rather than analog. But, you should know that to create a voltmeter a large resistance is placed in series with the galvanometer. You should know that to create an ammeter a small resistance is placed in parallel with the galvanometer.

You should know that we cannot take perfect measurements of I and V for a circuit. The voltmeter placed in parallel does change the resistance of the circuit slightly. The ammeter placed in series does change the resistance of the circuit slightly. Digital meters have much less effect on circuits compared to analog meters that were in use in the 1900&#39;s.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. If the voltmeter is in series you have just added 106 ohms to the circuit. The I value will be drastically lower.

Q2. If the ammeter is in parallel you have just added less than 1 ohm in parallel and probably have greatly reduced the net resistance of the circuit and increased I. It is likely you will burn out the ammeter.

## 21.5 Null Measurements

### To Do

  - Explain why a null measurement device is more accurate than a standard voltmeter or ammeter.
  - Understand how the value of an EMF can be measured accurately
  - Demonstrate how a Wheatstone bridge can be used to accurately calculate the resistance in a circuit.

### Notes

In a null measurement some quantity is being balanced to produce a zero reading. Null measurements can give more significant figures to the measurement. Null measurements have applications beyond electrical circuits.

The Potentiometer

The potentiometer uses a null effect to determine the potential of some unknown battery. In Figure 21-35, the standard EMF at the top of the diagram creates a current in the top loop. The value of RX is adjusted until the galvanometer reads zero. This indicates that the EMF of the unknown battery is equal to the voltage drop across RX . When the galvanometer reads zero, the standard EMF is not putting any current into the branch that contains the unknown EMF.

V=IR is written for the standard EMF top loop and for the unknown EMF

EMFstandard = I(RStandard) and EMFX = I RX        The value of I is the same for both equations.

Do you agree with the equation for EMFX that is given in the online textbook? (It is correct.)

Q1. Which EMF should be greater?    EMFstandard   or   EMFX  ?

Resistance Measurements and the Wheatstone Bridge

A null measurement can also be done for resistors.

In order to create the null effect in Figure 21-37 what is the desired potential of point b compared to the potential of point d? (The switch is closed.)

RX  = R3 R2 / R1

 What questions do you have on the derivation of this equation?

## 21.6 DC Circuits Containing Resistors and Capacitors

### To Do

-
  - Explain the importance of the time constant, τ , and calculate the time constant for a given resistance and capacitance.
  - Describe what happens to a graph of the voltage across a capacitor as it charges or discharges.
  - Explain how a timing circuit works and list some applications.

### Notes

There are several applications that use a resistor in series with a capacitor. When this combination is connected to a battery the resistor limits the rate at which the capacitor is charged (because R limits the current). Some examples are: the flash circuit for a camera, frequency generators, crude clocks.

Figure 21.38 shows a RC circuit.

Q2. If the capacitor Q = 0 what is the potential difference across the plates of the capacitor?

At time = 0 the RC arrangement is connected to the battery.

Q5. Why does the potential across the capacitor not increase as fast as time advances?

V = V0(1 − e−t / RC)                  &quot;time constant&quot; τ = RC   units of seconds for Ohms \* Farads

V0  is the EMF of the battery

In the equation above what is the result if t = 0 seconds?

In the equation above what is the result if t = infinity?

Discharging a Capacitor

Suppose you have a charged capacitor that is connected to a resistor (no battery). The electrons on the negative plate of the capacitor will move through R towards the positive plate. The capacitor will discharge. When Q = 0 the capacitor is fully discharged.

V = V0 e−t / RC

In the equation above what is the result if t = 0 seconds?

In the equation above what is the result if t = infinity?

Q3. What will cause the capacitor to discharge more slowly?

_RC_ Circuits for Timing

You should understand how the RC circuit can be used for timing.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. EMFstandard  should be larger. If EMFstandard  is smaller a null result cannot be obtained. A portion of EMFstandard is the potential difference across RX .

 Q2. Q= CV   so V must be zero.

Q3. As charge builds up on the capacitor a potential difference builds up on the capacitor. Electrons move in response to potential difference. The + plate of the capacitor is approaching the +V of the battery so there is less motivation for the electrons to move in the wire.

Q4. A larger R will limit the current and slow down the discharge compared to when a small R is used.

# Ch 22: Magnetism

## Introduction

There is a very close relation between electricity and magnetism. The understanding of electric and magnetic effects developed throughout the 1800&#39;s. The two effects were firmly linked together in the late 1860&#39;s by Maxwell when he described light as a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. You should definitely read the introduction to this chapter in the OpenStax Physics textbook.

## Terms to Know

-
  - magnet, pole, magnetic monopole, ferromagnet, electromagnet, Curie Temperature, domain, magnetic field, right hand rule
  - Hall Effect, magnetic force, magnetic torque

## 22.1 Magnets

### To Do

-
  - Describe the difference between the north and south poles of a magnet.
  - Describe how magnetic poles interact with each other.

### Notes

There are similarities between magnetism and electricity. Magnets can attract or repel, and there are two labels for magnets, north seeking and south seeking poles (similar to + and – charges). But there are important differences as well. We can isolate a proton or electron but no one has ever observed an isolated north magnetic pole nor an isolated south magnetic pole. There are some theories that say magnetic monopoles should exist but they have never been observed. Magnets from large size to atom size all have a north and south magnetic &quot;pole.&quot;

How many &quot;poles&quot; does a permanent magnet have?

Q1. What happens when a bar magnet is cut in half?

Q2. TRUE or FALSE  The magnetic force is due to isolated magnetic &quot;charges&quot; that we call North and South poles.

The Earth&#39;s magnetic field is similar to the magnetic field from a bar magnet. BUT there is no permanent magnet in the core of the Earth. The magnetic field of the Earth acts as though a south magnetic pole was near the north geographic pole of the Earth. We will discuss the best theory for the source of the Earth&#39;s magnetic field later.

How does a traditional compass needle indicate the direction of the magnetic field?

Is the magnetic field of the earth similar in pattern to the magnetic field of a bar magnet?

How does the position of the earth&#39;s north magnetic pole compare to the position of the north geographic pole?

Why is it unlikely that at large bar magnet in the interior of the earth is responsible for the earth&#39;s magnetic field?

## 22.2 Ferromagnets and Electromagnets

### To Do

  - Define ferromagnet.
  - Describe the role of magnetic domains in magnetization.
  - Explain the significance of the Curie temperature.
  - Describe the relationship between electricity and magnetism.

### Notes

What is ferromagnetic material?

It turns out that there are two sources for magnetic fields. One source is a current (moving charges) in devices known as electromagnets. The other source is the &quot;spin&quot; of electrons.

Q3. What is a magnetic domain? (Be sure to read the answer.)

The text has a nice side by side photo of a coil of wire carrying current and a bar magnet. The iron filings line up with the magnetic field for each object and show us that the two effects generate very similar magnetic fields.

The alignment of the electron spins can be disrupted by knocking or bumping the atoms into one another. When the atoms bump the electron orientation is disturbed. One way to increase the bumping is to raise the temperature of the permanent magnet. At a temperature above the Curie Temperature a permanent magnet will lose its magnetism. Also, if you want to keep your permanent magnet in top form do not drop it or hit it on any object. A collision will bump the atoms in the domains and weaken the permanent magnet.

Do you think a permanent magnet would survive if it was inside a pie in an oven?

Current (2015) computer hard drives use magnetism to record 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s. However it may not be too long before solid state drives replace magnetic hard drives. The solid state drives don&#39;t have moving parts that wear out (but backups will still be recommended).

Current: The Source of All Magnetism

I have already commented on this topic.

## 22.3 Magnetic Fields and Magnetic Field Lines

### To Do

  - Define magnetic field and describe the magnetic field lines of various magnetic fields.

### Notes

The concept of magnetic field is used to help use calculate magnetic force. We used a similar approach when we used electric field to calculate the value of electric force.

Comment on Figure 22.16    You will use a Right Hand Rule to determine the direction of magnetic field due to a current in a wire. Place the thumb of your right hand in the direction of the conventional current. Wrap your fingers around the wire. Your fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field. We will use the Right Hand Rule to help us discover the direction of magnetic force in place of vector calculations. (Our textbook calls this Right Hand Rule #2 and discusses it later in the chapter.)

You should memorize the four properties of magnetic field lines that are stated in our textbook. Property 4 is much different than the electric field lines. Electric field lines start on positive charges and end on negative charges.

Q4. Why don&#39;t magnetic field lines start on north poles and end on south poles?

## 22.4 Magnetic Field Strength: Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field

### To Do

  - Describe the effects of magnetic fields on moving charges.
  - Use the right hand rule 1 to determine the velocity of a charge, the direction of the magnetic field, and the direction of the magnetic force
  - on a moving charge.
  - Calculate the magnetic force on a moving charge.

### Notes

A charge that is moving in the presence of a magnetic field will experience a force.

        F = qvB sinθ        θ is the angle between the velocity and the magnetic field.
    
                        The standard metric unit for B is the Tesla. 1 Tesla is a large magnetic field.

Know the right hand rule for determining the direction of F. I prefer a different description of the right hand rule than what is shown in our textbook. You can use either method as long as you get the right answer for the direction!

1. Extend the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the velocity.

2. Rotate your wrist so it is easy to bend your fingers into the direction of the magnetic frield.

3. If q is positive your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic force.

     If q is negative the force is in the opposite direction to your thumb.

It is important to note that the force is perpendicular to both the velocity and to the magnetic field.

Q5. TRUE or FALSE  A proton is moving at a speed of 700 m/s parallel to a magnetic field that has a strength of 0.04 Teslas. The magnetic force is zero.

What angle between the velocity and magnetic field gives the largest force?

## 22.5 Force on a Moving Charge in a Magnetic Field: Examples and Applications

### To Do

  - Describe the effects of a magnetic field on a moving charge.
  - Calculate the radius of curvature of the path of a charge that is moving in a magnetic field.

### Notes

Dig back through the physics knowledge in your subconscious. What topic in the first semester had a force perpendicular to the velocity?................................... Right! Circular Motion.

As illustrated in Figure 22.20 we will use situations where the magnetic field has the same direction and same strength over an extended area. The magnetic force creates a centripetal force on the moving charge. FC = mv2/r       r is the radius of the path of the charged particle.

Since the magnetic force is supplying the centripetal force: qvB sinθ = mv2/r

        For most of our problems sinθ = 1   so   qvB = mv2/r     or                      r = mv/(qB)

If the charge has a component of its velocity parallel to B the charge will move in a helix (book calls this a spiral).

The book discusses how a magnet can be damaging to an old-fashioned TV screen such as in Figure 22.21 (TV sets with cathode ray tubes instead of LCD screens). The magnet is not changing the properties of the glass. The magnetic field penetrates the glass and magnetizes the iron screen inside the glass tube. With the external magnet removed the magnetic field due to the magnetized iron screen affects the path of the electrons coming towards the phosphor at the front of the tube and the image is distorted. Don&#39;t try this at home if you have an older TV that is not a flat screen TV, as it will permanently magnetize the iron screen near the front of the cathode ray tube and ruin the TV.

The Earth&#39;s magnetic field is important as a line of defense against radiation entering the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. It also plays a major role in forming the beautiful aurora displays. The Van Allen radiation belts are an important part of the space environment near Earth.

Mass spectrometers are discussed in the next reading guide.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. You will then have two shorter magnets. Each of the new magnets will have a south and north pole.

Q2. False  The poles of a magnet are concentrated regions where the magnetic effect is strong but there are no magnetic monopoles.

Q3. A magnetic domain is a finite region of a material in which the electron spins of atoms are lined up to a better extent than unmagnetized material. The small magnetic field from huge numbers of electrons produces a measureable and significant magnetic field in the permanent magnet.

Q4. There are no known magnetic monopoles. i.e. There are no isolated north or south poles. The magnetic effect is different than the electric effect. We won&#39;t delve into this too much but the magnetic effect for currents can be explained applying Einstein&#39;s Special Relativity theory to moving charges.

Q5. True   θ has a value of 0 degrees so the sine function evaluates to zero.

### Notes

We have already discussed the magnetic force on a charged particle.

We treat the current as positive particles moving in the wire. The magnetic force on the wire is

F = ILB sinθ                        I is the current in amps, L is the length of the wire in the B field

                        Θ is the angle between the direction of I and the direction of B.

We will use a right hand rule to find the direction of the force.

1. Extend the fingers of your right hand in the direction of the conventional current.

2. Rotate your wrist so it is easy to bend your fingers into the direction of the magnetic frield.

3. Your thumb points in the direction of the magnetic force.

## 22.8 Torque on a Current Loop: Motors and Meters

### To Do

  - Describe how motors and meters work in terms of torque on a current loop.

### Notes

You should understand the direction of the rotation of the loop. Use the right hand rule for a wire in a B field to get the direction of the force. The torque is the force times the lever arm. The torque can be clockwise or counterclockwise. We will not do calculations in this section.

How does a galvanometer display a reading that indicates the current value?

Q3. Why does the current need to reverse directions every half cycle in a simple motor?

### To Do

  - Calculate current that produces a magnetic field.
  - Use the right hand rule 2 to determine the direction of current or the direction of magnetic field loops.

For a long straight wire  B = ( μo I )/ ( 2 π r)                μo = 4 π x 10-7    I is in amps

                                                        r is the shortest distance from the wire in meters.

Ampere&#39;s Law and Others

Ampere&#39;s Law    Σ B|| ΔL =  μo I     For simple geometries Ampere&#39;s Law can be used to find B without using Calculus.

Magnetic Field Produced by a Current-Carrying Circular Loop

A single loop of wire that has a current will create a magnetic field:

B = ( μo I )/ ( 2 r)     This is the value of B at the center of the loop.

If there are multiple loops simply multiply by the number of loops, N.

B = (N μo I )/ ( 2 r)

You can use the right hand rule to find the direction of B.

Magnetic Field Produced by a Current-Carrying Solenoid

A solenoid is a coil of wire in the shape of a cylinder. Inside the solenoid the magnetic field is nearly uniform and has a value of

B = (N μo I )/ L   where L is the length of the solenoid and N is the number of turns of wire.

## 22.11 More Applications of Magnetism

### To Do

  - Describe some applications of magnetism.

### Notes

Mass Spectrometry

You should know how does a mass spectrometer works.

r = mv/(qB)     You should know the source of this equation.

In order to calculate the mass, r is measured. Also, the velocity of the object must be known. The velocity selector uses an electric force and magnetic force to only allow a certain velocity to enter the region where there is only a magnetic field. If the ion source releases ions do you think the drawing in the text (Figure 22.43) shows the correct direction for the magnetic field (given the + and – labels on the plates)?

Why does the velocity of ions that make it through the gap in the wall = E/B ?

Describe what happens to ions that have a velocity above the desired velocity value.

Describe what happens to ions that have a velocity below the desired velocity value.

Other Applications

How does an ordinary speaker produce sound?

Why is coaxial cable used to carry TV (and other) signals?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. A magnetic field deflects the charge carriers in a wire. The sides of the wire then have a potential difference due to this deflection of the charge carrier. Measurements of the sign of the potential difference show that electrons are the charge carriers in a wire.

Q2. The force is maximum if the current and the magnetic field are perpendicular (angle 90 degrees). The force is zero if the current and B field are parallel.

Q3. If the current did not reverse directions the torque would reverse directions. The coil of the motor would oscillate back and forth rather than continue its rotation in one direction.

Q4. Increase I, increase N, decrease L.

Q5. The ampere is defined based on the magnetic force between two long straight wires. When the current creates an interaction of 2 x 10-7 Newtons/meter the current value is 1 amp.

# Ch 23: Electromagnetic Induction, AC Circuits, and Electrical Technologies

## Introduction

Electric current creates magnetic field. In this chapter you learn how a magnetic field can be used to create electric current. Batteries create current by converting chemical energy to electrical energy. In this chapter you will see how mechanical energy can be converted to electrical energy. Electrical generators have a key role in our technology driven society.

## Terms to Know

  - induction, magnetic flux, induced EMF,  Faraday&#39;s Law, Lenz&#39;s Law, eddy current, magnetic damping, generator
  - back EMF, transformer, ground, inductance, RLC

## 23.1 Induced Emf and Magnetic Flux

### To Do

  - Calculate the flux of a uniform magnetic field through a loop of arbitrary orientation.
  - Describe methods to produce an electromotive force (emf) with a magnetic field or magnet and a loop of wire.

### Notes

Q1. In Figure 23.3 what situation leads to the induction of a current in the circuit that includes the galvanometer?

Q2. TRUE or FALSE  Electrons in the circuit that includes the battery move to the wire of the circuit that includes the galvanometer.

A permanent magnet can be the source of the magnetic field as well as the electromagnet shown in Figure 23.3. When the magnet moves towards or away from the coil, the strength of the magnetic field at the coil changes and a current is detected.

Magnetic Flux

There is more to generating current than just changing the value of B. The orientation of the area of the loop to the direction of B is important. This is evaluated by calculating the magnetic flux.

Φ = BA cos θ     A is the area of the loop of wire. Θ is the angle between the direction of B and the line that is perpendicular to the area.

Q3. List three conditions that produce zero magnetic flux.

## 23.2 Faraday&#39;s Law of Induction: Lenz&#39;s Law

### To Do

  - Calculate emf, current, and magnetic fields using Faraday&#39;s Law.
  - Explain the physical results of Lenz&#39;s Law

### Notes

Faraday determined that the induced EMF was proportional to the total change of magnetic flux and inversely proportional to the time required for the change to take place.

Faraday&#39;s Law  EMF = -N ΔΦB /(Δt)      N is the number of turns of wire in the coil

The minus sign is not important when you calculate the EMF. The minus sign reminds you to use Lenz&#39;s Law to find the direction of the induced current. This is explained below.

Know Lenz&#39;s Law:  The direction of the induced (conventional) current is such as to oppose the change that is taking place.

Know how to find the direction of induced current. This will involve

1. knowing the direction of the magnetic field

2. knowing if the magnetic flux is increasing or decreasing

3. trial and error in guessing the direction of the induced current and use of the right hand rule

Applications of Electromagnetic Induction

How does the principle of induced EMF apply to the dark strip on the back of a credit card?

You should read about the other applications of induced EMF. You are not responsible for the details of these applications. Just know that a change in magnetic flux induces an EMF.

We will use Faraday&#39;s Law to calculate the EMF (volts) for a variety of situations.

## 23.3 Motional Emf

### To Do

  - Calculate emf, force, magnetic field, and work due to the motion of an object in a magnetic field.

### Notes

The first discussion in this section deals with situations in which the magnetic field is stationary. Motion is used to change the area of the coil.

Know how to find the value of EMF and current (magnitude and direction) for a rod moving on a set of rails that form a closed circuit.

An EMF is also generated when the magnetic field moves across the area of the coil.

## 23.4 Eddy Currents and Magnetic Damping

### To Do

  - Explain the magnitude and direction of an induced eddy current, and the effect this will have on the object it is induced in.
  - Describe several applications of magnetic damping.

### Notes

We may see a demonstration of magnetic damping that uses a pendulum made of aluminum and a powerful horseshoe magnet.

Eddy currents, and the magnetic damping, are reduced if the resistance of the material is higher or the conductor has narrow strips that allow small current loops that have opposing directions.

Applications of Magnetic Damping

Do you agree that magnetic damping can be used to bring a double pan balance to its final position in a short amount of time?

Q4. How is magnetic damping able to separate aluminum from paper at a recycling plant?  Aluminum is not a ferromagnetic material.

You should read the descriptions of metal detectors and magnetic braking.

## 23.5 Electric Generators

### To Do

  - Calculate the emf induced in a generator.
  - Calculate the peak emf which can be induced in a particular generator system.

### Notes

A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The mechanical energy may be provided by fission of uranium, burning of coal or oil, wind, or water.

Why is there an induced EMF when the coil in a generator turns?

Q5. TRUE or FALSE  A changing magnetic flux will produce an electric field.

Faraday&#39;s Law  EMF = -N ΔΦB /(Δt)   We can use Faraday&#39;s Law to find the average EMF produced in a generator. You should read the example in the textbook.

To find the EMF at any instant of time we use     EMF = N B A ω sin(ωt)     ω = 2πf

f is the frequency of the rotation of the generator in cycles per second (rotations per second).

ω is the angular velocity in radians/second. t is the time in seconds.

How can the value of the EMF be increased?

What is the difference in the construction of an AC and a DC generator?  Note that the DC generator does not deliver a constant EMF, but the EMF is always in the same direction.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. There must be a change in the magnetic field in the coil around the iron ring to induce a current in the coil of the circuit that includes the galvanometer. When the switch is open the current is zero. When the switch is closed there is a change in the value of current in the coil. If the current has a steady value there is no current in the circuit that contains the galvanometer. When the switch is opened the galvanometer will register a current.

Q2. False. The circuits are separate. The energy is transferred by the magnetic field created by the coil. There is energy transfer to the coil that is in the circuit with the galvanometer only when the magnetic field is changing.

Q3. B = 0 ;   A = 0;     θ = 90 or 270 degrees    At these angles the magnetic field lines are parallel to the surface of the coil, no magnetic field line passes through the coil.

Q4. The magnetic field at the recycling plant is not picking up the metal. The magnetic field creates eddy currents in the metal that affect the motion of the metal. Since metals (i.e. aluminum) are conductors this technique works for all metals that are moving past the magnet. The induced current in the metal can generate a magnetic field that is repelled by the magnetic field under the conveyor belt. This can toss the metal off of the conveyor belt.

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How\_are\_metals\_separated\_from\_paper\_in\_the\_recycling\_process

Q5. TRUE   EMF establishes a potential difference    E =  EMF/distance

## 23.6 Back Emf

### To Do

  - Explain what back EMF is and how it is induced.
  - Calculate power in a motor with and without back EMF

### Notes

Q1. Where is back (counter) EMF found and what is its cause?

TRUE or FALSE   Back EMF reduces the current in a motor.

Why do the lights in some kitchens dim when the refrigerator motor starts?

Be able to do calculations of I and Power for electric motors when the back EMF is 0 and when there is a given value of back EMF. The basic technique is to subtract the EMF&#39;s and then calculate I.

Q2. Why is it dangerous for the bearings to fail on an electric motor?

## 23.7 Transformers

### To Do

  - Explain how a transformer works.
  - Calculate voltage, current, and/or number of turns given the other quantities.

### Notes

Semiconductors (transistors, integrated circuits, computers, etc.) often are used in circuits that have about 5 volts of potential difference. You cannot connect an integrated circuit or recharge a flashlight battery by connecting it directly to the 120 volt (rms) wall outlet. There are two reasons for this. 1) The wall outlet is AC and DC is needed to recharge a battery or run a semiconductor, and 2) 120 volts would destroy a device that is designed to operate at 5 volts.

Transformers provide part of the solution to the problem stated above. Transformers change the voltage (and current) from one circuit to another circuit. We will not discuss the solution to the problem of AC vs. DC. If this interests you do a search for DC power supply or rectifier.

The &quot;brick&quot; power supply for a computer or other small electronic device has a transformer and other electronic components to change the 120 volt AC power from the wall outlet to DC with a voltage of 5 volts, or 12 volts, etc.

How do transformers help to reduce the waste of energy in the distribution of electrical power in the USA from the power plant to the consumer?  The textbook has a nice drawing but does not specifically say why there is less power loss in the transmission lines when high voltage is used. You should write an explanation for the reduction in power loss in more detail than just saying &quot;less current&quot; or &quot;less line loss.&quot;  Remember that power loss in a wire is related to the square of the value of the current in the wire. P = I2R

You should be able to explain the meanings of &quot;primary coil&quot; and &quot;secondary coil.&quot;

Q3. How is a transformer constructed and how is electrical power transferred to the secondary coil?

VS = VP NS  /NP

Q4. Why do transformers not work with DC?

Almost all of the power in the primary coil is available to the secondary coil:  IP VP  about =  IS  VS

You should know the meaning of &quot;step-up&quot; and &quot;step-down.&quot;

Eddy currents in a transformer lead to electrical energy being lost due to heating of the iron of the transformer by the eddy currents. How are eddy currents minimized in a transformer?

## 23.8 Electrical Safety: Systems and Devices

### To Do

  - Explain why a three-wire connection can provide protection to users of electrical equipment

### Notes

You should read through this material. You should know why a three-prong plug (and wiring) has safety advantages.

## 23.9 Inductance 23.10 RL Circuits  23.11 Reactance, Inductive and Capacitive

### To Do

  - Explain why inductors interact with AC signals

### Notes

Inductors are coils of wire with perhaps an iron core to concentrate the magnetic field. An inductor will store energy in its magnetic field and oppose changes in current in an AC circuit. A circuit that contains an inductor has more resistance when the frequency of the AC increases.

You should know why an inductor interacts with an AC signal.

## 23.10 RL Circuits

### To Do

  - skip

## 23.11 Reactance, Inductive and Capacitive

### To Do

  - skip.

## 23.12 Reactance, Inductive and Capacitive

### To Do

  - Explain why the RLC circuit has a minimum resistance at a certain frequency

### Notes

When a resistor, capacitor, and inductor are placed in series they have an interesting behavior as the frequency of the AC changes. Capacitors act as large resistors for low frequency currents. Inductors act as large resistors for high frequency currents. At some intermediate frequency the overall resistance of the RLC circuit is a minimum. This can be used to let a certain frequency move through the circuit while blocking signals that have high or low frequency. You should know why the RLC circuit has a minimum resistance at a certain frequency.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. It is found in motors. Motors are also generators while they are spinning. Following Lenz&#39;s Law, the induced EMF of the spinning motor opposes the applied voltage to the motor.

Q2. If the bearings fail the motor stops rotating and the back EMF goes to 0. This leads to a great increase in the current in the winding of the motor and an even greater increase in the power delivered to the windings of the motor (I2 R). If you are every near a motor that stops spinning, for some reason other than the power being turned off, you should unplug that motor immediately.

Q3. A transformer has a two coils of wire and an iron core. The coils of wire are parts of separate electrical circuits. AC electrical power in the primary coil produces a changing magnetic field in the iron. The changing magnetic field of the first coil is guided to the second coil by the iron. The changing magnetic field in the second coil results in changing magnetic flux and thus an induced current in the second circuit. The electrical power is transferred to the secondary coil by means of the magnetic field as long as the magnetic field is variable.

Q4. DC (direct current) typically has a constant voltage and current. If DC is applied to the primary coil a magnetic field will be established in the iron core of the transformer, but it will be a constant magnetic field. Only a changing magnetic field can induce a current in the secondary coil.

# Ch 24: Electromagnetic Waves

## Introduction

How would you describe light?

Q1. Why do different types of light (e.g. x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, etc.) have different effects?

Q2. How does light differ from other waves (i.e. sound waves, water waves, waves on a rope, earthquake waves, etc.)

Discovering a New Phenomenon

There is a pattern in the advance of scientific knowledge:  1) observation 2) hypothesis 3) controlled experiment. In the early 1800&#39;s physicists observed electric and magnetic effects and came to the conclusion that there is an interaction between electricity and magnetism. Current creates magnetic field and a magnetic field can be used to create current. In the 1860&#39;s Maxwell modified Ampere&#39;s Law and then used four equations to form the hypothesis that there was an electromagnetic wave (oscillating electric and magnetic fields). This hypothesis predicted a speed for the wave of around 3 x 108 m/s. around 1850 the speed of light had been measured to be around 3 x 108 m/s. Experiments after 1870 confirmed that light is an electromagnetic wave that contains oscillating electric and magnetic fields.

## Terms to Know

  - electromagnetic wave, wavelength, frequency, spectrum, energy, gamma, x-ray, UV, visible, infrared, microwave, radio
  - electromagnetic wave, wavelength, frequency, spectrum, energy, intensity, power

**Introduction to Electromagnetic Waves**

## 24.1 Maxwell&#39;s Equations: Electromagnetic Waves Predicted and Observed

### To Do

  - Restate Maxwell&#39;s equations with understanding of the concept for each equation.

### Notes

You should read through the description of the equations in our textbook.

Another description of the equations is:

1. Gauss&#39;s Law for Electricity    The sum of the electric flux through a closed surface is equal to the net charge inside that surface divided by the electric constant ε0 .

Concept: There are separate + and – charges.

Σ  (E  dA cosθ ) = qinside /  ε0

2. Gauss&#39;s Law for Magnetism    The sum of the magnetic flux through a closed surface is 0. This summarizes the fact that no magnetic monopoles have been observed.

Concept: There are no isolated magnetic poles.

Σ  (B  dA cosθ ) = 0

3. Ampere&#39;s Law   The sum of the magnetic field times the path length around a closed loop is equal to the net current that penetrates the loop PLUS the rate of change of the electric flux through the loop. The second term was added to Ampere&#39;s Law by Maxwell.

Concept: Current or a changing electric flux creates magnetic field.

Σ  (B  dL cosθ ) =  μ0 I  +  μ0 ε0 ΔΦElectric field/Δt

4. Faraday&#39;s Law  The sum of the electric field times the path length around a closed loop is equal to the rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop.

Concept: A changing value of the magnetic flux creates electric field (and thus EMF in a wire).

 Σ  (E  dL cosθ ) = - N ΔΦMagnetic field/Δt

Maxwell was an excellent mathematician. When he combined the four equations he found that they predicted the existence of a wave that traveled with a speed of   v = 1 / sqrt(μ0 ε0 ). You should calculate this value before class.

Hertz&#39;s Observations

Summarize how Hertz verified the existence of EM waves.

The interference observation confirmed that the electromagnetic radiation was a wave.

The relationship between wave velocity, frequency and wavelength is

 v = f λ    or  c = f λ    where c represents the speed of light.

Q3. What is the wavelength of an EM wave that has a frequency of 1040 kHz?

The speed of the EM wave is the same for all frequencies. Describe what happens to the wavelength as the frequency increases.

## 24.2 Production of Electromagnetic Waves

### To Do

  - Describe the electric and magnetic waves as they move out from a source, such as an AC generator.
  - Explain the mathematical relationship between the magnetic field strength and the electrical field strength.
  - Calculate the maximum strength of the magnetic field in an electromagnetic wave, given the maximum electric field strength.

### Notes

What questions do you have on the production of the Electric field and magnetic field by the varying current in the wire. (Figure 24.5 and 24.6)?

Classical Physics predicts that an accelerated charge will produce an EM wave.

Why is an EM wave labeled a transverse wave?

The discussion in the text describes what happens for E and B near a wire carrying a variable current. How does the EM wave continue to propagate when it is far from the wire?  (i.e. How can light travel through the vacuum of space from the Sun to the Earth?)

Receiving Electromagnetic Waves

You should read about the effects of the length and shape of the antenna on the ability to receive EM waves that have different wavelengths.

You should know that the incoming EM wave causes electrons to move in the antenna. The equipment in the receiver detects the motion of the electrons and converts this signal to some useful form (audio, video, 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s, etc.)

Relating _E_ -Field and _B_ -Field Strengths

Analysis of Maxwell&#39;s EM wave shows that there is a relationship between the E and B fields.

E/B = c     or    B = E/c     The magnetic field value will be smaller than the E field value for the wave.

## 24.3 The Electromagnetic Spectrum

### To Do

  - List three &quot;rules of thumb&quot; that apply to the different frequencies along the electromagnetic spectrum.
  - Explain why the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength of an electromagnetic wave.
  - Draw a simplified electromagnetic spectrum, indicating the relative positions, frequencies, and spacing of the different types of radiation bands.
  - List and explain the different methods by which electromagnetic waves are produced across the spectrum.
  - . Describe a property, use, or danger for each portion of the EM spectrum

### Notes

You should study the table 24.1. Gamma rays are the most energetic form of light. Radio waves are the least energetic form of light. The parts of the spectrum are listed in order of increasing energy. Memorize this order.

You should know the EM Spectrum rules of thumb.

Transmission, Reflection, and Absorption

Different materials interact with EM waves differently depending on the frequency of the EM wave.

What portions of the EM spectrum can easily pass through the Earth&#39;s atmosphere?

Radio and TV Waves

You should read about the differences between AM radio and FM radio.

How many radio stations do you think it is possible to listen to in our classroom?

Why don&#39;t we here all of these stations at the same time when a radio is turned on?

You should know that the radio can listen to one station at a time due to resonance in the radio at one frequency allowing the signal from the antenna for that frequency to be amplified while blocking the other signals.

Our textbook is a little out of date concerning TV. The TV signals in the USA are now digital. The use of digital allows more information to be transmitted in a smaller range of frequencies. This will allow for more channels. There is competition for the use of the EM spectrum and no one is making more EM spectrum!

Radio Wave Interference

You should read this material.

Microwaves

Q4. Why do microwaves carry more information than radio waves?

How does the radar unit determine the distance to an object that is reflecting the radar waves?

Heating with Microwaves

A microwave oven uses a frequency for the microwaves that is absorbed well by water. The water molecules move back and forth due to the EM wave. This back and forth motion becomes thermal energy in the food.

Infrared Radiation

TRUE or FALSE  Infrared light has a wavelength that is longer than 700 nm.

List two uses of infrared light.

The Earth absorbs about 70% (not 50%) of the sunlight that hits our upper atmosphere. It is true that there is a beneficial greenhouse effect that raises the average temperature of the Earth by about 40 degrees Celsius.

Visible Light

TRUE or FALSE  The visible portion of the EM spectrum is a wide and major portion of the spectrum.

TRUE or FALSE  The Earth&#39;s atmosphere is nearly transparent to visible light.

Ultraviolet Radiation

What are some adverse effects of UV light on humans?

What protective measures can be used to minimize those effects?

UV Light and the Ozone Layer

How does the ozone layer protect humans from UV light?

Where is there a major hole in the ozone layer?

Benefits of UV Light

Why does your body produce less vitamin D in the winter (in Nebraska)?

X-Rays

X-Rays can be produced by causing high speed electrons to decelerate. (e.g. let the electrons hit a piece of metal). X-Rays an ionize more atoms than UV light and are thus more dangerous. But they have a positive use in medical imaging. The X-ray images give a diagnosis without the need for surgery. X-rays can be focused on a cancer to deter its growth.

Gamma Rays

Gamma rays are produced in the nuclei of atoms. They are the highest energy and most dangerous EM radiation.

Detecting Electromagnetic Waves from Space

Astronomers can observe in visual and radio wavelengths with equipment on the Earth. Some infrared observations can be made using telescopes on high mountains in dry climates (water vapor absorbs infrared). A vast increase in knowledge of the universe has occurred with the placement of gamma ray, x-ray, UV, and infrared telescopes in space.

## 24.4 Energy in Electromagnetic Waves

### To Do

  - Explain how the energy and amplitude of an electromagnetic wave are related.
  - Given its power output and the heating area, calculate the intensity of a microwave oven&#39;s electromagnetic field, as well as its peak electric and magnetic field strengths

### Notes

Write down how you have experienced the fact that EM waves carry energy.

Q1, What topic from first semester is being described by the statement in the book that transfer of energy is more efficient if the frequency of the EM wave is the same as the natural frequency of the system?

Q2, It is a general property of waves that the energy of the wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the wave. Suppose the EM wave &quot;A&quot; carries 1.5 x 10-18 Joules. EM wave &quot;B&quot; has an amplitude three times greater than wave A. Calculate the energy carried by wave B.

The electric and magnetic fields in an EM wave are variable. The average value of the intensity of the EM wave can be calculated using

Iavg = E0 B0 / 2 μ0   where E0 is the maximum value of the electric field and B0 is the maximum value of the magnetic field. In some problems you will need to remember B = E/c .

The peak intensity  I0 = 2 Iavg

Intensity = power / area       I = P/A

What questions do you have on the examples worked in this chapter?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Resonance   (e.g. Tacoma Narrows Bridge)

Q2. You must square the amplitude ratio. 32 = 9    B energy = 9 \* 1.5 x 10-18 = 1.35 x 10-17 J

# Ch 25: Geometric Optics

## Introduction

This chapter will discuss applications of light for which the light can be considered to be traveling in a straight line except when it reflects (e.g. off a mirror) or refracts (e.g. its path is bent as it passes from air into water). This occurs as long as the light encounters objects that are very large compared to the wavelength of the light. Can you draw the wave for visible light on this page with the proper distance between the peaks of the wave?  Why or why not?

Chapter 27 will discuss applications where light energy is spread out when the light moves through a small opening.

## Terms to Know

  - ray, beam, normal, reflection, specular reflection, diffuse reflection, refraction, index of refraction, Snell&#39;s Law, total internal reflection, critical angle, fiber optics, corner reflector
  - wavelength, frequency, color, dispersion, converging lens, diverging lens, focal length, focal point, magnification, optic axis, object, image, image distance, object distance
  - concave, convex, corner reflector, radius of curvature, real image, virtual image

## 25.1 The Ray Aspect of Light

### To Do

  - List the ways by which light travels from a source to another location.

### Notes

Q1. What is a ray?

The &quot;ray&quot; model is a convenience that allows us to more quickly analyze how light energy moves as it encounters mirrors and lenses. It is important that you remember that light is actually a wave.

If there is no material between the source and the screen where the ray hits, the ray travels in a straight line. If there is a mirror or lens between the source and some screen the ray will likely change directions before it reaches the screen.

## 25.2 The Law of Reflection

### To Do

  - Explain reflection of light from polished and rough surfaces.

### Notes

Reflection is a common process for rays of light. The law of reflection applies to one thin ray as it reflects from a surface.

Q2. What is a normal?  Where is it drawn in a diagram and how is it oriented with respect to the surface?                    It is important to note that every ray has its own normal.

The Law of Reflection describes how a ray leaves a surface after reflecting.

    θi =   θr      These are the angles for the incident ( i ) ray and reflected ( r ) rays. By convention (tradition) the angle is measured from the normal to the ray. A ray that is approaching a surface directly will have a small angle. A ray that is just grazing a surface will have a large angle.

A beam of light consists of a multitude of rays. There is a difference in the outcome if a beam of light reflects off of a smooth or rough surface. Each ray in the beam has its own normal.

Mirrors will be curved in a later section but the rays will still individually obey the principles given in this section.

Specular reflection occurs when a beam of light reflects from a smooth surface. The smooth surface may be curved. What objects in our class room exhibit specular reflection?

Diffuse reflection occurs when a beam of light reflects from a rough surface. What objects in our class room exhibit diffuse reflection?

What is the cause of the difference between specular and diffuse reflection?

Q3. What is an image?

An image is found by tracing rays from one spot on the object to the place where the rays (or extensions of reflected or refracted rays) cross. We will get practice with this when we locate images formed by refraction and reflection.

## 25.3 The Law of Refraction

### To Do

  - Determine the index of refraction, given the speed of light in a medium.
  - . Understand and Apply Snell&#39;s Law

### Notes

Refraction occurs because light travels at different speeds in different media. The speed of light is only equal to 3 x 108  m/s in a vacuum.

There was a time when it was believed that light traveled infinitely fast. Measurements by Roemer in the late 1600&#39;s showed this was not true. The &quot;clock&quot; of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter runs fast and slow in a predictable way based on the extra distance the light has to travel to the Earth as the Earth orbits the Sun.

By the late 1800&#39;s the speed of light through air was measured with great precision. Later the speed of light was measured as the light traveled through various gases, liquids, and transparent solids (e.g. glass).

Light has its greatest speed when it travels through a vacuum. The speed of light is slower in gases, liquids, and solids. The index of refraction is a measure of how much the speed of light decreases in these materials.

 n = c / v        n is the index of refraction (not an integer), v is the speed of light in the material

                We will use 3 x 108 for the value of the speed of light.

For the table listed in the textbook, what material has the highest index of refraction?

Imagine a marching band that starts on pavement and then moves into a muddy field. Imagine that the band is not marching directly into the field but is entering at an angle (like the lawn mower in the figure in the textbook). The band members who reach the muddy field first will not be able to step as far on each stride as the members who are still on the pavement. This will cause the whole band to change direction as the band continues into the muddy field. You should make a little sketch of this with dots for each member of the band. Make each row of dots a certain distance apart while on the pavement. Imagine the band moving forward and put a new row of dots in the direction the band is marching. Reduce the distance to the dots as the band enters the muddy field.

The band members are likely taking a step with every major beat of the drum line. The marching frequency is constant. The same thing occurs with light. The frequency of the light is the same in a vacuum and in some medium (e.g. air, water, glass). The speed of light is reduced in the medium and the wavelength of the light is reduced in the medium. For all waves: v = λf

Snell&#39;s Law describes the relationship between the index of refraction and angle of the ray away from the normal. The normal is perpendicular to the surface at the point where the ray hits. For refraction the normal is drawn on both sides of the boundary between the two media. If the ray is traveling directly down the normal the angle is zero. If the ray is grazing the boundary between the two media the angle is 90o.

Snell&#39;s Law               n1 \* sin θ1   =  n2 \* sin  θ2

Q4. When you view an object in water, why does the object appear to be closer to the surface of water than it actually is?

## 25.4 Total Internal Reflection

### To Do

25.4. Total Internal Reflection

  - Explain the phenomenon of total internal reflection.
  - Describe the workings and uses of fiber optics.
  - Analyze corner reflectors and the reason for the sparkle of diamonds.

### Notes

This effect occurs when the ray starts in the medium with the larger index of refraction.

What is the largest number that can be successfully processed by the inverse sine function?  Try taking inverse sine of these values with your calculator: 0.4,  0.9,  1.0,  1.1 .

Suppose a ray of light starts in medium 1 and hits the boundary with medium 2. Solve Snell&#39;s law for θ2.using only symbols, not numbers. This will require you to take the inverse sine as a final step.

θ2   =

The value of θ1  that produces θ2 = 90o is called the critical angle, θC .. If θ1 is larger than θC then total internal reflection occurs. If the boundary does not have irregularities, 100% of the energy of the light is reflected.

Q5. Under what circumstances can total internal reflection occur?

What questions do you have on fiber optics?  List some applications of fiber optics.

Corner Reflectors and Diamonds

Is it possible to construct a mirror system with flat mirrors that will cause the reflected ray to be parallel (but going in the opposite direction) to the incoming ray?   Hint: What safety device is attached to the spokes of a bicycle wheel to help car drivers see bicycles at night?

How do astronomers know that the Moon is moving farther away from the Earth every year?   AND, how many optical devices on the Moon can be used for this measurement?

The Sparkle of Diamonds

Why does light have trouble getting out of a diamond?

We will discuss dispersion in the next section.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. A ray is a straight line that indicates the direction the energy of the light is moving. The ray will change direction if it encounters a mirror or lens. A light bulb has rays that move outward in all directions. A laser has one ray direction. A rough object (not a mirror) that is reflecting light will have rays moving outward in all directions.

Q2. The normal is a line drawn perpendicular to the surface at the point where a ray hits the surface.

Q3. An image is produced by reflection or refraction (lenses) of light from an object. The image may be the same size or larger or smaller. The image may have the same orientation as the object or be inverted (upside down) or reversed (left to right). We will learn how to determine the nature of the image as we study different types of mirrors and lenses.

Q4. You should draw a fish under a layer of water that has a smooth surface (no waves). Roughly trace two rays from the front of the fish towards the air and out into the air. Since the index of refraction is smaller for air than for water, the angle of a ray in air is larger than the angle of a ray in water. Now, extend the rays that are in air back into the water until the two rays cross. This gives the location of the image of the fish.

Q5. The ray needs to start in the medium that has the higher index of refraction. The angle of the starting ray has to be relatively large.

Why does white light create colors when the light passes through a prism?

## 25.5 Dispersion: The Rainbow and Prisms

### To Do

  - Explain the phenomenon of dispersion and discuss its advantages and disadvantages.

### Notes

ROYGBV    Know these colors in the visible spectrum in order. Red has the longest wavelength and smallest frequency of these colors.

Q1. What causes dispersion?

List the three optical steps that light undergoes when a rainbow is produced.

Suppose you see a rainbow towards the eastern horizon. Where is the Sun in the sky?

Q2. TRUE or FALSE  Dispersion occurs when light reflects off of a surface.

Suppose these two types of glass exist:

Glass A has index of refraction values 1.555 for blue, 1.553 for red.

Glass B has index of refraction values 1.578 for blue, 1.560 for red.

Which glass will produce the largest dispersion effect? (i.e. best separation of colors)

## 25.6 Image Formation by Lenses

### To Do

  - List the rules for ray tracing for thin lenses.
  - Illustrate the formation of images using the technique of ray tracing.
  - Determine power of a lens given the focal length.
  - Calculate the location of an image
  - Calculate the magnification value for a lens
  - Perform ray tracing and calculations when two lenses are used to produce an image

### Notes

We will find image locations using ray tracing and calculations. The ray tracing techniques and equations apply best when the thickness of the lens is small compared to the diameter of the lens. Unless you are told otherwise we will assume the lenses meet this condition. We will not consider dispersion for these thin lenses.

The optic axis passes through the center of the lens and is perpendicular to the cross sectional area of the lens. Figure 25.27 shows a thicker lens than we will use. I may do ray tracing by refracting the ray when it is at the center of the lens.

If a light ray is parallel to the optic axis of a converging lens it will be refracted by the lens through the focal point of the lens on the opposite side of the lens from where the light entered the lens. The focal length, f, is the distance from the center of the lens to the focal point. Light from a very distant source will be parallel to the optic axis. A lens has a focal point on each side of the lens. The values for f are the same for both sides of the lens.

The &quot;power&quot; of a lens is measured in diopters P = 1/f       f is measured in meters. If you have your eyes checked and need corrective lenses you will see diopter numbers written for the prescription. Why did I put quotes around the word &quot;power.&quot;

How is the focal point for a diverging lens found?

Note that f is positive for a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens.

Q3. What is the difference in appearance for converging and diverging lenses?

You must memorize the rules for ray tracing for converging lenses:

1. An incoming ray parallel to the optic axis is refracted through the focal point

2. An incoming ray that passes through the focus exits the lens parallel to the optic axis

3. An incoming ray that passes through the center of the lens continues in a straight line.

There are some simple modifications of these rules for diverging lenses.

Image Formation by Thin Lenses

Objects send out light in all directions. You will need to trace two rays from the object to locate the image. Typically we just locate the image for the top of the object. We don&#39;t do ray tracing for every point on the object. When two rays from the object cross we have located the image.

A real image is a location where there is actual concentration of energy. A camera will record an image if it is placed at the location of a real image.

A virtual image is a location where there is not an actual concentration of energy (e.g. the image you see in a mirror is a virtual image). A camera will not record an image if it is placed at the location of a virtual image.

Thin Lens Calculations                di  is the distance from the center of the lens to the image

   1             1              1                do  is the distance from the center of the lens to the object

  ----    +   ----     =   -----

   di            do              f

You must memorize the sign conventions for f,  di, and do for lenses.

m = - di/do   =  hi/ho     magnification    The sign of the magnification is associated with the orientation of the image. If the magnification for a single lens is negative the image is inverted.

hi is the height of the image    ho is the height of the object.

Q4. TRUE or FALSE   A diverging lens can be used as a simple magnifier.

Where does the object have to be located for a lens to act as a simple magnifier?  Give a general description of the location.

What questions do you have on the problem solving method for lenses?

You should be able to do calculations and ray tracings to find an image in situations which involve one or two converging or diverging lenses.

The image formed by the first lens is the object for the second lens. You must determine the object distance for the second lens. You must determine if the object distance for the second lens is a positive or negative number.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. The value of the index of refraction has a slight dependence on the frequency of the light. In general, the index of refraction is highest for violet light and smallest for red light. The angle of the refracted ray calculated using Snell&#39;s Law depends on the index of refraction.

Q2. FALSE   The value of the reflected angle is equal to the value of the incident angle. The reflected angle does not depend on the frequency of the light.

Q3. A converging lens is thicker at the center than at the edge. A diverging lens is thinner at the center than at the edge.

Q4. False   Only converging lenses act as simple magnifiers.

## 25.7 Image Formation by Mirrors

### To Do

  - Illustrate image formation in a flat mirror.
  - Explain with ray diagrams the formation of an image using spherical mirrors.
  - Determine focal length and magnification given radius of curvature, distance of object and image.

### Notes

Know how to trace rays to find the image location for a plane mirror.

Is it possible to construct a mirror system with flat mirrors that will cause the reflected ray to be parallel (but going in the opposite direction) to the incoming ray?   Hint: What safety device is attached to the spokes of a bicycle wheel to help car drivers see bicycles at night? (Corner reflector)

Know how to find all image locations for mirrors that join at a right angle.

The ray tracing and calculations will be easy as they are similar to the lens problems.

Q1. Why do rays that approach a curved mirror parallel to each other not leave the mirror parallel to each other?

The mirror has an optic axis that is drawn perpendicular to the cross sectional area of the mirror. The optic axis hits the center of the mirror.

Q2. Where is the zero location for position measurements for mirrors?

For the simple, spherical mirrors we will analyze, the focal length has a value equal to half the radius value. f = R/2

Know how to draw and do ray tracing for a concave and a convex mirror.

You must memorize the rules for ray tracing for concave mirrors:

1. An incoming ray parallel to the optic axis is reflected through the focal point

2. An incoming ray that passes through the focus exits the mirror parallel to the optic axis

3. An incoming ray that passes through the center of curvature reflects back on itself.

There are some simple modifications of these rules for convex mirrors.

   1             1              1

  ----    +   ----     =   -----       m = - di/do   magnification    What is the significance of the sign?

   di            do              f

You must memorize the sign conventions for f,  di, and do for mirrors.

The concave mirror has a positive focal length. The center of the concave mirror is farther from the object that the edge of the mirror. The convex mirror has a negative focal length. The center of the mirror is closer to the object than the edge of the mirror. In some ways, the concave mirror acts like the converging lens and the convex mirror acts like the diverging lens.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Rays at different distances from the optic axis strike the mirror at different locations. The direction of the normal for each different ray has a different direction compared to another normal.

Q2. At the center of the mirror where the optic axis hits the mirror.

# Ch 26: Vision and Optical Instruments

## Introduction

## Terms to Know

  - cornea, iris, lens, retina, Near point, far point, nearsighted, farsighted, simple magnifier
  - microscope, telescope, objective, eyepiece, magnification, chromatic and spherical aberration, adaptive optics

## 26.1 Physics of the Eye

### To Do

  - Explain the image formation by the eye.
  - Analyze the accommodation of the eye for distant and near vision.

### Notes

We will discuss the major optical features of the eye. We will treat the cornea and lens combination as a single thin lens.

Compare these parts of the eye to a camera:  pupil, retina, cornea, lens.

The image of any object must be focused on the retina to see a clear image.

Why is the image distance a fixed number for the eye?

How does the eye accomplish the focusing of objects that are different distances from the eye?

Q1. What is accommodation?

The muscles attached to the lens are able to change the shape of the lens and thus change its focal length.

Q2. Why do some older people wear bifocals or trifocals, etc.?

Q3. What are the near and far points?

Describe the change in the focal length that allows a person to clearly see a close object.

Power of a lens:   Diopters = 1 / f (in meters)

## 26.2 Vision Correction

### To Do

  - Identify and discuss common vision defects.
  - Explain nearsightedness and farsightedness corrections.

### Notes

What causes nearsightedness and how is it corrected?

What causes farsightedness and how is it corrected?

Know how to calculate the power of corrective lenses.

We will not discuss astigmatism or laser vision correction.

What questions do you have on the examples in the book?

In preparation for discussing microscopes and telescopes you should know the essential characteristics and working principle of the simple magnifier.

Magnification M = Near point distance / f     for image at infinity (relaxed eye)      Average near point = 25 cm

                Add 1 to M if the image is at the near point

## 26.3 Color and Color Vision

### Notes

You should read this section.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Accommodation refers to the changing of the focal length of the eye to cause objects with different object distances to be in focus.

Q2. As the body ages, the lens becomes less flexible and the muscles are not able to change its focal length as much.

Q3. The near point is the closest object distance for which the object can be seen clearly. The average near point for a young adult is 25 cm.

        The far point is the furthest object distance for which the object can be seen clearly. For a young eye this is infinity.

## 26.4 Microscopes

### To Do

  - Investigate different types of microscopes.
  - Learn how image is formed in a compound microscope, calculate magnification

### Notes

The microscopes we will discuss just have two lenses. Both lenses have a short focal length. Both lenses produce magnification of the object. You should know how to do the ray tracing to locate the intermediate and final image for a microscope that uses two converging lenses.

Q1. Why does the objective magnify the object?

Q2. Why does the eyepiece magnify the image created by the objective?

The magnification is found by multiplying the magnification for each lens. mobj \* meyepiece

For each lens, the magnification is -di / do .

You should read about the numerical aperture, or f/number.

As will be discussed in a future chapter, if the wavelength is shorter the microscope is better able to see details in an object. We will find in a future chapter that particles act as waves when they travel. The wavelength of the electrons can be selected to be smaller than violet light so small objects can be imaged.

## 26.5 Telescopes

### To Do

  - Outline the invention and use of a telescope.
  - Describe the working of a telescope, light gathering power, magnification

### Notes

The telescope was invented in the Netherlands by Hans Lippershey. Galileo made telescopes and was the first to record and publish extensive observations of objects with the telescope. His observations (1609) showed that the Earth was not the center of the solar system.

The main purpose of a telescope is to gather light so dim objects can be viewed. The light gathering power depends on the area of the objective. Telescopes are usually compared with ratios of the squares of the diameters. e.g. 11 inch diameter telescope vs. 8 inch diameter telescope

11 inch telescope gathers more light by a factor of    112 / 82   =   1.89 or almost 2 times more light

Q3. What is the difference between a refracting and a reflecting telescope?

Know how to do the ray tracing to locate the intermediate and final image for the case of two converging lenses.

Know the purpose of the objective and the eyepiece.

        M = - fo / fe

If you purchase a telescope is the diameter of the objective or the magnifying power most important?

Q4. What are two advantages of a reflecting telescope over a refracting telescope?

Know how to make a Galilean telescope and its advantage over the simple telescope.

TRUE or FALSE  The Hubble telescope produces images that show more details than any other telescope for astronomical objects.

Why do reflecting telescopes not suffer from chromatic aberration?  And, what prevents the largest telescopes from being made with a lens for the objective?

## 26.6 Aberrations

### To Do

  - Describe spherical and chromatic aberration and know how they are corrected

### Notes

How is dispersion related to chromatic aberration?

Chromatic aberration can be minimized by using an &quot;achromat&quot; lens. This is a two lens combination of converging and diverging lenses that have different indices of refraction. It is expensive.

Q5. How can spherical aberration be minimized?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. The object is a short distance beyond the focal length so do so di is large and the magnification is large.

Q2. The image formed by the objective is inside the focal length of the eyepiece. The eyepiece acts as simple magnifier.

Q3. Refracting: a lens is used for the objective. Reflecting: A mirror is used for the objective.

Q4. The reflecting telescope does not have chromatic aberration from the objective and can be made larger than a refracting telescope.

Q5. Use a parabolic mirror, or an expensive non-spherical lens. Or, just use the section of the objective near the optic axis by blocking the outer portion of the objective.

# Ch 27: Wave Optics

## Introduction

Try to recall some situations in which you have seen colors when white light reflects off of a surface  (e.g. soap bubble, oil slick on the street, butterfly wings, CD or DVD... optional site: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural\_coloration). If the law of reflection is true (it is) and all colors reflect at the same angle, why are different colors seen at different angles?  This chapter will explain these effects. This chapter will involve situations where the energy of the light does NOT simply travel in straight lines.

## Terms to Know

  - diffraction grating, iridescence, single slit, diffraction , missing order
  - diffraction, resolution, thin film, phase shift, in phase, out of phase, constructive interference, destructive interference, polarization, vertically polarized, horizontally polarized, crossed polaroids

## 27.1 The Wave Aspect of Light: Interference

### To Do

  - Discuss the wave character of light.
  - Identify the changes when light enters a medium.

### Notes

Maxwell developed equations that showed light is an electromagnetic wave. When light interacts with large objects ( much larger than the wavelength) you can use the ray model and geometric optics to locate the images. You should calculate the wavelength for visible light.

 c = f λ     We will need to treat the light as a wave as it moves past and interacts with objects that have a size smaller than, or comparable to, the wavelength of the light.

Explanations for Figure 27-3:  In the top frame the laser is not making the star nor the Milky Way glow. The photographer chose to take the picture from a location that put the laser in line with those objects. In the bottom frame, as few as two vertical slits can be used to make this photo. The number of bright spots you see from left to right is NOT equal to the number of vertical slits.

In class and lab we may see a demonstration of laser light passing through two parallel slits. We will NOT see two spots of light on the screen after the laser light passes through two slits. We will see the interference pattern shown in the lower frame of Figure 27-3.

Q1. Consider a ray of light entering a medium after traveling in air. What two properties of the light change?

We will need this equation when we discuss thin films in a future section:  λ&#39;  =   λ / n

## 27.2 Huygens&#39;s Principle: Diffraction

### To Do

  - Discuss Huygens&#39;s principle.

### Notes

A wavelet is a small semicircle that is drawn in the direction that the wave is traveling. The center point of the wavelet is on the wavefront of the wave.

Write out Huygen&#39;s Principle here.

We will not use Huygen&#39;s Principle to determine how light waves reflect, refract, or behave when moving past an object.

Why does sound &quot;bend&quot; around corners?  The answer is not that the sound is reflecting off of walls or the floor or ceiling.

## 27.3 Young&#39;s Double Slit Experiment

### To Do

  - Explain the phenomena of interference.
  - Define constructive interference for a double slit and destructive interference for a double slit.
  - · Calculate the angles and distances to bright and dark spots on the screen

### Notes

Newton proposed that light was best described as particles that traveled in straight lines. Huygens proposed that light traveled as a wave

Q2. How could scientists decide who was right?

If you shine a flashlight at a piece of cardboard that has two adjacent thin openings what would you expect for the pattern of light on the other side of the cardboard?

Coherent light has the peaks of the waves aligned with other peaks. (analogy:  everyone in a marching band steps forward with their left foot at the same time).

Monochromatic light has only one wavelength (specific color) .

What is your conclusion about the nature of light after you examine the drawing of Young&#39;s Double Slit Experiment (1801) (Figure 27.10)?

Write down your definition of

constructive interference                                destructive interference

Note that Figure 27.12 shows monochromatic, coherent light, passing through the slits.

You should write down your summary of why some locations on the screen are bright and why some locations on the screen are dark.

The &quot;take home&quot; experiment regarding looking at a street light through the gap in two fingers is a diffraction effect that will be explained in a future section.

Double Slit Interference

What causes the waves from the two slits in the double slit experiment to be out of phase?

… to be in phase?

The angles to the bright spots on the screen  are found using:

d sin θ = m λ         m = … -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …

The angles to the dark spots on the screen  are found using:

d sin θ = (m + ½) λ         m = … -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …

The central maximum occurs for m = 0 (0th order).

The first maximum on either side of the central maximum occurs for m = -1 and m = +1.

(1st order)

To calculate distances on the screen:    tan θ = Y/L    Y is the distance from the central maximum to the location on the screen. L is the distance from the double slit to the screen.

Q3. Why is the interference pattern only seen when coherent sources are used?

Would you expect to see an interference pattern from two thin light bulbs that are set up 0.3 centimeters from each other?   Explain.

What questions do you have on the examples worked out in the textbook?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. The speed of light is slower in the medium than in air. The wavelength of the light is also reduced by a factor of n, the index of refraction. The frequency of the light wave is constant.

Q2. A controlled experiment is used to determine which hypothesis is false. The appropriate experiment here is to let light pass through two slits and observe if two spots are observed on a screen or if more than two spots are observed.

Q3. If the source is not coherent the waves at the two openings will not be in phase. There will be some random phase relationship. The waves have to be in phase at the slits to have the constructive interference occur at one location on the screen. If the waves are incoherent at the two slits there will be constructive interference (and destructive interference) at all points along the screen for each individual wave leaving the slits. You would see dim light spread out along the screen instead of alternating bright and dark spots on the screen.

## 27.4 Multiple Slit Diffraction

### To Do

  - Discuss the pattern obtained from diffraction grating.
  - Explain diffraction grating effects.

### Notes

Write a description of a diffraction grating.

When monochromatic, coherent, light passes through a diffraction grating maxima and minima are produced at the same angles that result when the same wavelength light passes through a double slit.

The angles to the bright spots on the screen are found using:

d sin θ = m λ         m = … -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, …

Q1. What two advantages does the diffraction grating have over just two slits?

The angle to the maxima depends on the wavelength of the light. As Figures 27.16 and 27.20 show, the diffraction grating will separate the colors (wavelengths) of light and allow scientists to inspect the amount of light for each color (wavelength).

How does the spectrum formed by a prism compare to the spectrum formed by a diffraction grating? (e.g. Which color is dispersed by the greatest angle for the prism and for the diffraction grating?)

Q2. Why is it often true that only the first order (m=1) and second order (m=2) maxima are present when a diffraction grating is used?   (i.e. There are no maxima for m=3 or m=4, etc.)

What causes iridescence?

What questions do you have on the examples in the textbook?

## 27.5 Single Slit Diffraction

### To Do

  - Discuss and calculate the single slit diffraction pattern.
  - Understand what causes missing orders.

### Notes

Write a summary of what leads to interference of light when only a single slit is used.

The angle to the minima (destructive interference) for the single slit diffraction are computed using

D sin θ = m λ         m =  … -3, -2, -1, (skip 0), 1, 2, 3, …        D is the width of the slit.

Q3. There is no simple equation for the location of the maxima for the double slit. Where are the maxima located for the single slit diffraction pattern?

The maxima become less bright as the angle increases. This is shown in Figure 27.24.

Q4. Each slit of a double slit acts as a single slit. Suppose that the double slit equation predicts a maximum at an angle of 8 degrees but the single slit equation predicts a minimum at the angle of 8 degrees. What will be seen on the screen, a maximum (bright spot) or a minimum (dark spot)?

A missing order occurs when the angle for a maximum from the double slit equation is the same as the angle for a minimum predicted by the single slit equation.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Advantage #1: The maxima are narrower when a diffraction grating is used. The maxima are narrower because the light contributed from the slits will start to produce destructive interference at angles just slightly different from the angle calculated from the double slit equation. Since there are more slits the light can become out of phase for slits that are far from each other when the angle is slightly different than the angle calculated from the double slit equation.

Advantage#2:  Usually, the distance between slits for the diffraction grating is much smaller than the distance between slits for the double slit. This causes the angle to the maxima to be larger. This allows for a better determination of the angle for a certain color and a better determination of the wavelength for that color.

Q2. The equation for the diffraction grating maxima is: d sin θ = m λ  . The value of sin θ must be less than 1 in order to take the invers sine function and find the angle. d is small. When m becomes larger  sin θ can be greater than 1 for visible light. If sin θ is greater than 1 the maxima does not exist.

Q3. The maxima for the single slit fringe pattern are about halfway between the minima.

Q4. A dark spot is observed. The single slit prediction dominates the pattern. At the 8 degree angle there is 0 light from each slit. You could say that there is constructive interference with the light from the two slits, but the constructive interference is  0 + 0  with the result of 0.

## 27.6 Limits of Resolution: The Rayleigh Criterion

### To Do

  - Discuss the Rayleigh criterion.
  - Calculate the minimum angle for resolving objects
  - Calculate the physical distance between objects that are resolved

### Notes

Q1. Why does a beam of light spread out after it passes through a circular opening?

Figure 27.25 illustrates the problem in resolving two objects. The images of the objects have an inherent width due to diffraction. If the objects are too close together (frame c) the objects are not clearly separated and are said to &quot;not be resolved.&quot;  Imagine that you want to see craters on the Moon. If the two craters are too close together their images overlap due to diffraction and you cannot see the two separate craters.

Write down the definition for the Rayleigh criterion.

The angle to the first minimum in the diffraction pattern for a circular opening is approximately:

θ =1.22 λ / D                Note that the wavelength and diameter must be in the same units. The units of θ are radians. There is no sine function in this equation.

You should perform the take home experiment to test the resolving ability of your eyes. The angle θ can be calculated by suing s = r θ. S is the distance between the lines. r is the distance from your eyes to the lines.

Describe how you would improve the resolution of an optical system. (two ways)

What questions do you have on the calculations for this topic?

Q2. Does the Hubble telescope produce the highest resolution images of any telescope?

## 27.7 Thin Film Interference

### To Do

  - Discuss the rainbow formation by thin films.
  - Calculate the thickness of a thin film

### Notes

Vibrant colors can be produced when light reflects from a thin film. Some of the light reflects from the top of the thin film and a portion of the light refracts into the thin film. Then, some of the light in the thin film reflects from the back surface of the thin film and refracts out into the air. The two beams of light can constructively and destructively interfere at certain wavelengths based on the type of material in the thin film and the thickness of the thin film.

The thin film will have a thickness comparable to the wavelength of light, but we will not analyze this as a diffraction situation. The constructive or destructive interference is produced by the two beams having an &quot;in phase&quot; or &quot;out of phase&quot; relationship.

We will not use a single equation to produce a prediction of in phase or out of phase. Instead, you will need to understand the physics of how the light reflects and understand the extra path length to know if the two beams are in phase or out of phase.

Q3. When does reflection cause a phase shift of ½ wavelength?

Note: There is no phase change when refraction occurs.

In the thin film the wavelength is different than the wavelength in air. Again, we will take the index of refraction in air to be 1.0. The wavelength in the thin film is         λ&#39;  =   λ / n   where n is the index of refraction of the thin film.

Problem Solving Steps to find the thickness of a thin film.

1. Know whether the two beams need to be in phase or out of phase at the eye.

2. Label any half wavelength shifts due to reflection.

3. Calculate the wavelength in the thin film.

4. Calculate the total path in the film in units of λ&#39; required to produce in phase or out of phase. (e.g. 1 λ&#39; or ½ λ&#39;) We will not account for the slanted path in the thin film. We will assume the angle is small and that the slanted path is approximately equal to the thickness of the thin film.

5. Calculate the thickness of the film in metric units. (often in units of nanometers)

Applications:  soap bubble, oil film, anti-reflective coating on glasses or camera lenses.

What questions do you have on the calculations for this topic?

Usually, we will only calculate the minimum thickness for the thin film. Thicker thin films will also have certain colors that are bright or missing.

## 27.8 Polarization

### To Do

-
  - Discuss the meaning of polarization.
  - . Describe how Polaroids produce polarized light
  - . Calculate the intensity of light that passes through Polaroids
  - . Describe how reflection and scattering can polarize light
  - Describe how LCD displays use polarization.

### Notes

What is Maxwell&#39;s description for light?

Q4. When is light said to be linearly polarized?

A beam of unpolarized light has all possible directions for the vibrations of the electric vectors of the light.

Describe vertically polarized light.

Describe horizontally polarized light.

Figure 27.38 shows the effect on how a polarized wave can be created. However, this figure is misleading regarding how polarized light is produced with a Polaroid.

How does a polaroid produce polarized light?

When unpolarized light passes through a Polaroid, 50% of the light is blocked by the Polaroid.

The intensity of polarized light the exits a Polaroid is given by:    I = Io cos2 θ

Io   is the intensity of the polarized light before it enters the Polaroid.

Θ is the angle between the direction of the electric vector of the polarized light and the polarization direction for the Polaroid.

Q5. What are crossed polaroids?

Unpolarized light is directed at crossed polaroids. What is the intensity of the light that exits crossed polaroids?

You should know that reflection from a horizontal surface can create horizontally polarized light. We will not perform the calculate that describes this process. Sunglasses are made to block light that is horizontally polarized so they block the glare of light that is reflecting from a horizontal surface.

The light of the blue sky is partially polarized due to the scattering of light from molecules. If it is not too cloudy we will view this.

Liquid Crystal Displays  Be able to give a basic explanation on how LCDs operate.

You should read section 27.9 but this reading guide does not discuss this section.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Diffraction    The wave nature of light causes the light to spread out as it passes through an opening, whether the opening is a rectangular slit or a circle.

Q2. No. The detail available in Hubble images is better than the details available in most Earth-based telescopes due to the &quot;twinkling&quot; effect caused by our atmosphere. Turbulence in the atmosphere leads to the production of small, local, density variations in the atmosphere. These density variations have different indices of refraction and act like small, moving, lenses to light passing through the atmosphere. Some telescopes on Earth are equipped with &quot;adaptive optics&quot; to compensate for the twinkling effect. A laser is used to create an artificial star in the upper atmosphere. The telescope has a small flexible mirror in the optical path. The shape of this flexible mirror is continuously varied by equipment to keep the artificial star as small as possible. The astronomical image of the object that is near, but does not include, the artificial star can show more detail than the images produced by the Hubble telescope because the diameter of the mirror on the Earth-based telescope is larger than the diameter of the Hubble telescope. However the area of the sky in these adaptive optics images is smaller than the area of the sky imaged by the Hubble telescope, so the Hubble telescope is still useful.

Q3. A half-wavelength phase shift only occurs if the ray reflects from a medium that has a higher index of refraction than the medium the ray moves in before the reflection.

Q4. Light is linearly polarized if all of the electric vectors in the beam of light are aligned in one direction.

Q5. When two sheets of Polaroid have parallel faces but have 90 degrees between their polarization directions they are called crossed Polaroids.

# Ch 28: Special Relativity

## Introduction

We are now moving into the area of &quot;modern physics&quot; in the textbook. Historically, &quot;classical physics&quot; ended around 1900. In the last decades of the 1800&#39;s physicists were starting to explore phenomena that could not be explained by the equations of classical physics. This included how atoms emit and absorb light, how solids emit light, the structure of the atom, how light causes electrons to be ejected from a metal, and radioactivity. In addition, in 1905 Einstein gave the world a new set of equations of motion that must be used for objects that are moving at high speed.

This chapter (Special Relativity) covers the laws of physics when there is no acceleration. About 10 years after Einstein developed Special Relativity he developed General Relativity which covers accelerating objects and gravity.

## Terms to Know

-
  - inertial reference frame, postulate, simultaneity, time dilation, proper time, length contraction, proper length
  - velocity addition, relativistic momentum, energy, KE, rest energy

## 28.1 Einstein&#39;s Postulates

### To Do

-
  - State and explain both of Einstein&#39;s postulates.
  - Explain what an inertial frame of reference is.
  - Describe one way the speed of light can be changed.

### Notes

Q1. What is an inertial reference frame?

Write out the two postulates of Special Relativity.

1.

2.

Postulate 1 is also known as the principle of Galilean relativity. It is a postulate that was accepted by classical physicists.

Not in the textbook: What is the &quot;luminiferous aether?&quot;   Who failed to detect it in 1887?

## 28.2 Simultaneity And Time Dilation

### To Do

-
  - Describe simultaneity.
  - Describe and calculate time dilation.
  - Calculate γ.
  - Compare proper time and the observer&#39;s measured time.
  - Explain why the twin paradox is a false paradox.

### Notes

Do observers in different inertial reference frames agree concerning simultaneous events?

What questions do you have on the thought experiment involving two flash lamps and the moving train car?

What is a gedanken experiment?

Einstein quote: &quot;When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come close to the conclusion that the gift of imagination has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing absolute knowledge.&quot;

TIME DILATION
Write the book&#39;s definition of time dilation.

Another description of time dilation is:  Moving clocks run slow.

Q2. Figure 28.6  You should imagine that the observer on Earth is holding an identical light clock to the one in the spacecraft. For the clock of the observer on Earth the light travels a distance &quot;2D&quot; as the light goes up to the top mirror an returns to the bottom of the clock. Why does it take longer for the light beam to travel on the path &quot;2s&quot; than on the path &quot;2D&quot;?

What is proper time?

The clock in your hand measures proper time.

We may derive the equation for time dilation in class.

Q3. How are elapsed time on a clock and time intervals between ticks of a clock related?

How is gamma calculated and used?      gamma,  γ  = 1 / sqrt( 1 – v2/c2 )

Calculate gamma for the cases of v = 0.01c      v = 0.1c    v = .8c  and v = .99c

Why would the GPS system have to take the effects of Special Relativity into account?

The Twin Paradox

What questions do you have on the Twin Paradox?

## 28.3 Length Contraction

### To Do

-
  - Describe proper length.
  - Calculate length contraction.
  - Explain why we don&#39;t notice these effects at everyday scales.

### Notes

Q4. What is a proper length?

What is length contraction?

L = Lo / gamma

Has Special Relativity been confirmed by experiments or measurements?  Describe one.

What questions do you have on the examples worked out in the textbook?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. A reference frame is a set of X and Y axes in which we can make measurements. An inertial reference frame has constant velocity (speed and direction).

Q2. The speed of light is a constant for both clocks. The path 2S is longer than the path 2D so it takes longer for the light to return to the bottom of the clock that is moving.

Q3. If the elapsed time between ticks is greater the clock will run slower. You can convince your self of this by saying &quot;tick tock tick tock …&quot; and moving your hand like a second hand at every tick. Change the rate at which you say tick tock and note the change in the angular motion of your hand.

Q4. The length of some object at rest with respect to you has proper length.

## 28.4 Relativistic Addition of Velocities

### To Do

-
  - Calculate relativistic velocity addition.
  - Explain when relativistic velocity addition should be used instead of classical addition of velocities.

### Notes

Classical Addition

What questions do you have on classical addition?

Relativistic Velocity Addition

Suppose a rocket traveling at 0.5c fires a missile ahead of the rocket. The missile leaves the rocket at 0.7c with respect to the rocket.

Q1. Why is the speed of the missile not 1.2c?

Special Relativity provides a way to add velocities and avoid arriving at a result faster than the speed of light.

U = (V + U&#39;) / (1 + (V \* U&#39;)/c2 )

V is the relative velocity between the two observers. U&#39; is the velocity relative to the moving observer.

You should do this calculation with U&#39; = c.

## 28.5 Relativistic Momentum

### To Do

-
  - Explain why the only mass it makes sense to talk about is rest mass.

### Notes

Conservation of momentum is a fundamental law of physics. In order to conserve momentum at high speeds an adjustment, by gamma, has to be made to the momentum of the moving objects. The relativistic momentum is larger than the classical value of momentum by the factor of gamma.

The mass of the object does not actually increase. Instead it behaves as if it has more mass in momentum and kinetic energy calculations.

## 28.6 Relativistic Energy

### To Do

-
  - Compute the total energy of a relativistic object.
  - Compute the kinetic energy of a relativistic object.
  - Describe rest energy, and explain how it can be converted

### Notes

Energy is conserved in Special Relativity.

Total Energy and Rest Energy

Total Energy   E = γ m c2         m is the mass of the object at rest, the only mass we will use.

If the speed is zero the object still has energy, a rest energy, E0 = mc2 .

Q2. What happened to the gamma symbol?????

Note that this equation tells us that mass is related to energy. This has been confirmed in nuclear fission and fusion experiments.

Kinetic Energy and the Ultimate Speed Limit

When work is done on an object its kinetic energy increases (assuming no change in potential energy).

Work = KE       Work = E – E0      Work = (γ – 1) m c2      or      KE =  (γ – 1) m c2

This is a more accurate calculation for KE than ½ m V2 .

Write your own summary of why no object can have a speed equal to the speed of light.

How can sunlight be used to propel a spacecraft through the solar system?  Your explanation should not refer to sunlight making electricity or sunlight generating some chemical reaction that would fuel a rocket.

CORRESPONDENCE PRINCIPLE

Q3. What is the correspondence principle?  How does this principle help us understand the historical development of our understanding of the universe?

What questions do you have on the examples worked out in the textbook?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Nothing can travel faster than light, 1c .

Q2. Gamma has a value of 1 when V is zero.

Q3. The equations of Special Relativity agree with (&quot;correspond to&quot;) the classical equations for low speeds. Older physics discoveries used older technology that did not reveal more extreme physical situations.

# Ch 29: Introduction to Quantum Physics

## Introduction

In the early 1900&#39;s physicists realized that the behavior of small objects was different from the classical physics models. We used this concept in the early part of the semester by saying that charge comes in packages of n \* 1.6 x 10-19 Coulombs. This is an example of quantization. But, there is much more than just quantization. We will discover that small objects can act like waves and apply that concept to better understand the atom. Again, there will be a correspondence principle in that the results of this chapter simplify to the classical physics equations for large objects.

## Terms to Know

-
  - quantized, photoelectric effect, photon
  - particle-wave duality, wave nature, de Broglie wavelength, uncertainty

## 29.1 Quantization of Energy

### To Do

-
  - Explain Max Planck&#39;s contribution to the development of quantum mechanics.
  - Explain why atomic spectra indicate quantization.

### Notes

A blackbody emits light at all wavelengths. The characteristics of the spectrum of the blackbody depend only on the temperature of the object, not on what type of elements are in the blackbody.

Solid objects, liquids, and dense gases emit light like a blackbody

The total power emitted by a sphere that is a blackbody is proportional to R2 T4 .

R is radius, T is temperature in Kelvins.

The energy emitted by a blackbody is not the same at all wavelengths. The radiation from a blackbody peaks at a wavelength that is related to the temperature of the object. Cool objects peak in the infrared, hotter objects peak in the ultraviolet.

Wien&#39;s Law lets us calculate the wavelength at which the most energy is being emitted by the blackbody.

        λmax = 2.9 x 10-3 /T  meters. T in Kelvins

The blackbody spectrum presents a problem to classical physics. The equations and understanding of classical physics cannot predict the observed spectrum of a blackbody. Some equations will match the spectrum at small wavelengths but be wrong at long wavelengths. Some equations will match the spectrum at long wavelengths but fail at short wavelengths. Physicists wanted to find one equation that would correctly describe the whole spectrum.

Planck derived the formula that correctly describes the blackbody spectrum only after he assumed that the energy of the oscillating atoms were quantized with E = (n + ½ ) h f

        n is an integer 0, 1, 2…     h is Planck&#39;s constant. 6.626x10-34 J seconds    f is frequency

Planck thought this restriction on the energy was just a mathematical trick that allowed him to derive the equation for the blackbody. However, this quantization of energy is real.

Q1. What is the smallest change in energy for an oscillator?   (Hint: e.g. N goes from 0 to 1.)

Atomic Spectra

List one feature of atomic spectra that is much different than the spectra of blackbodies.

The spectra have discrete features (emission lines or absorption lines) that are unique for each element. These spectra will be important in developing models for the atom in Chapter 30.

## 29.2 The Photoelectric Effect

### To Do

-
  - Describe a typical photoelectric-effect experiment.
  - Determine the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons ejected by photons of one energy or wavelength, when given the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons for a different photon energy or wavelength.

### Notes

When ultraviolet light falls on a set of wires it is easier to create a spark between the two wires. This suggests that the light is causing electrons to leave the wires and help in breaking down the insulating gap of air.

What is the photoelectric effect?

What is a photon?

You should be familiar with the 5 characteristics of the photoelectric effect. #3 is the only characteristic that agrees with classical physics. Characteristics 1,2,4, and 5 can only be explained using another new understanding of how the universe works; the photon model for light.

It is important to note that the KE in 5) is the maximum KE of the electrons. The electrons that are ejected from the surface of the metal will have this maximum KE. Electrons that are ejected from slightly under the surface have less KE. The BE quantity is often called the Work function and W is used as the symbol in other physics textbooks.

KE max = hf – BE

Einstein came up with this equation in 1905 and the model that light acts like a photon when the light is absorbed. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921 for the explanation of the photoelectric effect. List some devices that use the photoelectric effect.

## 29.3 Photon Energies and the Electromagnetic Spectrum

### To Do

-
  - Explain the relationship between the energy of a photon in joules or electron volts and its wavelength or frequency.
  - Calculate the number of photons per second emitted by a monochromatic source of specific wavelength and power.

### Notes

With the photon model we can easily calculate the energy associated with a particular wavelength of light. E = hf   and f = c / λ

It is more convenient to work with electron-volts (eV) than Joules for most atomic calculations. Planck&#39;s constant has a value of about 4.14 x 10-15 eV seconds .

A typical ionization energy is around 10 eV.

Q2. Define &quot;ionizing radiation.&quot;

Does visible light fall into the category of ionizing radiation?

You should be aware of how x-rays are produced but we will not do calculations for the voltage of the equipment.

## 29.4 Photon Momentum

### To Do

-
  - Relate the linear momentum of a photon to its energy or wavelength
  - Describe what occurs in the Compton effect.

### Notes

Experiments performed by Compton in the 1920&#39;s confirmed that light makes collisions with electrons and momentum is conserved. Photon momentum  p = h/λ

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. The smallest change in energy = hf.

Q2. Light (or alpha or beta particles) that can give an atom enough energy to remove an electron from the atom.

## 29.5 The Particle-Wave Duality

### To Do

-
  - Explain what the term particle-wave duality means, and why it is applied to EM radiation.

### Notes

Interference and diffraction show that light travels as a wave. The photoelectric effect shows that light should be treated like a particle (photon) when light is absorbed. This dual nature is far from a classical physics concept. But, experimental evidence supports this particle-wave dual explanation. You apply the correct model for the situation at hand.

What questions do you have on particle-wave duality?

## 29.6 The Wave Nature of Matter

### To Do

-
  - Describe the Davisson-Germer experiment, and explain how it provides evidence for the wave nature of electrons.

### Notes

Q1. Why did de Broglie propose that matter has a wave behavior?

    de Broglie wavelength      = h/(mv)

Why don&#39;t you observe the wave nature of a baseball as it is thrown?

What experimental evidence indicates that de Broglie was correct?

How is the wave nature of the electron used in an application?

## 29.7 Probability: The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

### To Do

-
  - Use both versions of Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle in calculations.
  - Explain the implications of Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle for measurements.

### Notes

Probability Distribution

Quantum Mechanics lets scientists calculate the probability that a particle will be in a certain range of locations or the probability that an object will have an energy within some range of energies. The textbook shows the probability distribution for an electron after the electron passes through two slits. This should remind you of the interference pattern you observed when light passes through two slits. Fig 29.26 is mislabeled for the b) frame. It should read &quot;photons&quot; not &quot;protons.&quot;

It is also worth noting that if you try to measure which slit the electron passed through you destroy the interference pattern.

Heisenberg Uncertainty

On a fundamental level, it turns out that there is an inherent uncertainty in the knowledge of measured items. In fact, the act of measurement disturbs the system and gives uncertainty to the measured items.

The uncertainty principle we will use for position and momentum is:

∆X  ∆px  \&gt;  h/(4 π )        ∆X is the uncertainty in the X location

                        ∆px is the uncertainty in the X component of the momentum

∆px will sometimes be expressed as m∆Vx  (mass times uncertainty in the X component of the velocity).

If you try to obtain better information on the location of a particle you will lose the ability to have accurate information on the velocity of the particle. You can visualize this result by recalling how the diffraction pattern spread out when the single slit became narrower. Narrowing the slit is equivalent to trying to obtain better information on the location. As this is done, the light had more uncertainty (spread out more) on where it would strike the screen. The central maximum spread out.

Q2. What makes the uncertainty in the velocity in the X direction larger?

There is also an uncertainty principle for energy and time:

   ∆E   ∆t   \&gt;  h/(4 π)                  ∆E   is the uncertainty in the energy value (in Joules)

                                ∆t is the length of time during which the energy value is measured.

Q3. What makes the uncertainty in the energy value larger?

The uncertainty principle for energy plays a role in alpha decay from nuclei. For a short time the kinetic energy of the alpha particle will be negative.

## 29.8 The Particle-Wave Duality Reviewed

### To Do

-
  - Explain the concept of particle-wave duality, and its scope.

### Notes

The concepts of particle-wave duality and uncertainty principles apply to all objects. But, it is only for small objects that the effect is important. When macroscopic objects are involved the equations of classical physics can be used.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. He assumed that nature was symmetric. With light having a particle and wave nature he assumed that matter would have the same behavior.

Q2. Any attempt to obtain better information on the X position will make the uncertainty in the X component of the momentum larger.

Q3. If the energy measurement is made during a shorter time interval, the uncertainty in the energy value is greater. This has applications in the emission of light from atoms and subatomic particles.

### To Do

-
  - Describe the basic structure of the atom, the substructure of all matter.

### Notes

The atom was a mystery in the 1800&#39;s. The constant proportions consumed in chemical reactions informed scientists that there were building blocks of elements but the details of atoms remained to be discovered.

Q1. What is the name of the first direct observation of atoms?   Describe the observation and the cause of the motion.

## 30.2 Discovery of the Parts of the Atom: Electrons and Nuclei

### To Do

-
  - Describe how electrons were discovered.
  - Describe Rutherford&#39;s gold foil experiment.
  - Describe Rutherford&#39;s planetary model of the atom.

### Notes

The Electron

Advances in technology in electrical equipment and in the production of vacuum tubes allowed for new discoveries in the late 1800&#39;s.

Is the cathode a positive or negative terminal?

How was Thomson able to deflect cathode rays?

Describe what the ratio   qe/m  tells us about a cathode ray.

Q2. What is a cathode ray?

After Millikan determined the charge on an electron, what could scientists calculate?

What is a proton?

Write down the mass of an electron and the mass of a proton.

The Nucleus

After the electron was discovered a model of the atom was developed that stated electrons were embedded inside a sphere of distributed positive charge. The amount of positive charge equaled the amount of negative charge on the electrons in the atom. This model is called the plum-pudding model of the atom.

Radioactivity had been discovered in the late 1800&#39;s. Physicists knew that charged particles were leaving the nuclei of radioactive elements at high speed. Some of these particles are called alpha particles. They have 2 protons and two neutrons and are thus positively charged. These high speed particles were used to probe the structure of the atom by Rutherford. What would you expect if you shot positive charges at the plum pudding atom?

What was the surprising result from Rutherford&#39;s scattering experiment?

Q3. How was the data of large deflections of the alpha particles explained?

How did this improve physicists view of the atom?

What is the approximate size of the nucleus and the approximate size of the atom?

Why did most of the alpha particles go straight through the atoms with only a small deflection?

What object has most of the mass of our solar system?

The planetary model of the atom was a good start toward understanding the structure of the atom but don&#39;t let it get too large of a hold in your mind. The atom is much, much, different that the solar system. The electrons do not have orbits that are similar to planets. And, the orbit of the Earth is only about 100 times larger than the Sun. The effective size of atoms is 100,000 times the diameter of the nucleus.

## 30.3 Bohr&#39;s Theory of the Hydrogen Atom

### To Do

-
  - Describe the mysteries of atomic spectra.
  - Explain Bohr&#39;s theory of the hydrogen atom.
  - Explain Bohr&#39;s planetary model of the atom.
  - Illustrate energy state using the energy-level diagram.
  - Describe the triumphs and limits of Bohr&#39;s theory.

### Notes

Now that positive charge is known to be in a small nucleus it is time to get a better understanding of the &quot;location&quot; of the electrons in an atom.

Mysteries of Atomic Spectra

A thin gas will emit a line spectrum (energy at selected wavelengths rather than a continuous spectrum). This is also called an emission spectrum. Every element has a unique set of spectral lines (unique wavelengths) in its emission spectrum.

When a continuous spectrum of light passes through a cooler thin gas, the amount of light at some wavelengths will be reduced. When the spectrum is viewed there will be dark lines, absorption lines in the spectrum. The spectrum is called an absorption spectrum.

In 1885 Balmer developed a formula for Hydrogen empirically. What is an empirical formula?

λ = 364.5 nm ( n2 / (  n2   – 4 ) )    n = 3,4,5, etc.

This formula is approximate and is only used for spectral lines of hydrogen in the visible spectrum.

You should memorize the names of the series of hydrogen emission and absorption lines.

Balmer series  (visible spectrum)

Lyman series (UV)

Paschen series (infrared)

A modern formula that is capable of calculating all of the wavelengths for the emission lines of hydrogen is the Rydberg formula

1/λ = R ( 1/ nf2   - 1/ni2   )    where R is the Rydberg constant, 1.097 x 107 m-1

                The f and i subscripts refer to final and initial states of the electron.
    
                f is equal to 2 for the Balmer spectral lines.

In classical physics, light is emitted when an electron is accelerated. Would an electron in an atom have force on it?  Yes, electrical force. Is it accelerated?  Yes, centripetal acceleration. When the electron emits light (according to classical physics) it should lose energy and its orbit should move closer to the nucleus. What does classical physics predict for the future of an electron orbiting a proton?

Bohr&#39;s Solution for Hydrogen

Q4. What are the two postulates of Bohr&#39;s theory for the Hydrogen atom?

Bohr made the hypothesis that the atom emits light when the electron jumps to a lower energy level.

hf = Eupper - Elower

What is true about the angular momentum of the electron in an atom?

The principal quantum number is the integer value of the orbit number. 1 is the orbit closest to the nucleus.

Don&#39;t get bogged down in the mathematics that develops the equation for the radius of the electron orbits. The radii values of Bohr orbits in the hydrogen atom increase with the square of n.

rn = n2 aB            aB  = 0.529×10

# −10
m.

Don&#39;t get bogged down in the development of the values of the energies for the electron.

En= -13.6 eV / n2

Q5. What is a ground state?            What is an excited state?

You should know how to construct and use an energy level diagram.

How much energy is required to ionize a hydrogen atom?

We will work problems related to the Bohr energy levels.

Triumphs and Limits of the Bohr Theory

Bohr&#39;s theory was a triumph because it allowed the calculation of the major spectral lines of hydrogen. The theory also produced a size for the atom that is in agreement with the results of Brownian motion data.

But, Bohr&#39;s theory only applies to hydrogen. And, Bohr&#39;s theory does not explain all of the details in the spectrum of hydrogen.

de Broglie&#39;s matter wavelength hypothesis supports the Bohr model of the atom. In the n = 1 state, one wavelength fits around the circumference of the orbit. In the n = 2 state, two wavelengths fit around the circumference of the orbit. Etc. The electron wave becomes a standing wave and is stable.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Brownian motion. Small objects (dust, pollen, etc.) in a liquid or air are observed to have sudden motion in random directions. The explanation for this is that they are being hit by atoms. When there are more atoms colliding with the object on one side than another it is seen to move.

Q2. A cathode ray is an electron.

Q3. In order to deflect the alpha particle through a large angle (e.g. 180 degrees) the alpha particle must be experiencing a large force inside the atom. Rutherford proposed that the atom contained a positive nucleus that repelled the positive alpha particle. In addition, the nucleus must be massive since it was not bumped out of the atom. The alpha particle bounced off of the nucleus like it had hit a brick wall.

Q4. Bohr assumed that the electron had quantized energy levels in the hydrogen atom. He also postulated that the electron orbits were stable and did not continuously radiate energy.

Q5. The ground state is the state with n = 1. An excited state is a state with n \&gt; 1.

## 30.4 X Rays: Atomic Origins and Applications

### To Do

-
  - Define x-ray tube and its spectrum.
  - Show the x-ray characteristic energy.
  - Specify the use of x rays in medical observations.

### Notes

When electrons accelerate they emit EM waves. This radiation is known as bremsstrahlung. Translate &quot;bremsstrahlung.&quot;

Write your own description of how x-rays are produced.

Does bremsstrahlung produce x-rays at a few specific wavelengths or x-rays at many wavelengths?

Q1. When does an atom emit a characteristic X-ray?

TRUE or FALSE   The characteristic X-rays produced when an electron beam hits copper have different energies than the characteristic X-rays produced when an electron beam hits aluminum.

Q2. What is the maximum x-ray energy for the case where electrons have been accelerated through a potential difference of 20,000 volts before they hit the anode?

The electron transitions that end at the lowest energy level, the n=1 orbit, generate K shell x-rays.

The approximate energy of the electron energy levels in multielectron atoms is given by

        En = -Z2 \* 13.6 eV / n2
    
        Z is the number of protons in the nucleus. e.g. Z = 6 for carbon.
    
        n is the orbit number, with 1 being the orbit closest to the nucleus.

The energy of the photon emitted is equal to Eupper level – Elower level  .

You should be aware of uses of x-rays.

Why is a diffraction pattern not seen for a dental x-ray?

## 30.5 Applications of Atomic Excitations and De-Excitations

### To Do

-
  - Define and discuss fluorescence and phosphorescence
  - Define metastable.
  - Describe how laser emission is produced.
  - Explain population inversion.
  - Define and discuss holography.

### Notes

Clothes can be made to show different colors by selecting dyes that absorb all of the colors except for the color you want the clothes to show. e.g. A blue shirt absorbs all the colors except blue. The blue light is reflected. This is not the complete story of colors but it is enough for our purposes.

Fluorescence and Phosphorescence

Write a description of the process of fluorescence.

Write a description of how a fluorescent bulb creates visible light.

Q3. Why do governments want to have consumers use fluorescent bulbs rather than incandescent bulbs?

What is an excited state (for an atom)?

Typically, electrons remain in an excited state in an atom for about a billionth of a second. What is a metastable state?

Write a description of the process of phosphorescence.

Lasers

Q4. How is a population inversion created?

An electron in an upper energy level can give up its energy in three ways. It can spontaneously drop down to a lower energy level. It can give up energy to another atom if the atoms collide. It can be encouraged to drop down to a lower energy level in a process called stimulated emission.

Absorption of a photon

If an electron is in a lower energy level it can absorb a photon of the proper energy and move to an upper energy level. The energy of the incoming photon has to be equal to the energy difference between the two energy levels.

Stimulated Emission

If a photon has an energy equal to the energy difference between the two energy levels and the electron is in the upper energy level, there is a probability that the photon will encourage the electron to drop down to the lower energy level and emit a photon. This process is called stimulated emission.

The original incoming photon and the photon from the stimulated emission have the same wavelength, travel in the same direction, and are in phase!  The photons are coherent.

In a laser atoms are put into a population inversion. A random atom will spontaneously emit a photon. That photon may encounter another excited atom and cause stimulated emission. These two photons may encounter a third excited atom and cause stimulated emission. These three photons may encounter a fourth excited atom and cause stimulated emission. Etc. The laser is built with two mirrors at the ends of a chamber that contains the atoms that have the metastable state. Photons moving in the right direction will reflect back and forth from the mirrors. One mirror is coated to allow some of the light to escape. This is the output of the laser. During this process the atoms are continually excited to move electrons back to the metastable state.

Why do the atoms need to be excited again in order for the laser to continually emit a beam of light?

Why does laser light have properties that are much different than the light from an ordinary light bulb?

What are two applications where lasers are useful?

It is worth noting that Einstein described the basic physics for the action of a laser in 1917. A working laser was developed in 1960.

Also worth noting is the extended legal battle over the patent rights to lasers. That legal case was settled in 1987, almost 30 years after the invention. If you have a good idea, make sure to get your notes notarized and have the date recorded!   For more information read this article:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser)

How are holograms made?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. A characteristic x-ray is emitted by an atom when an electron makes a transition from an upper energy level to a lower energy level in an atom that has several protons.

Q2. hf = qV    so hf = 20,000 eV or 20 KeV

Q3. An incandescent bulb does not convert all of the electrical energy to visible light. Most of the energy is radiated in the infrared region where our eyes cannot make use of the light. Fluorescent bulbs are much better at converting electrical energy to visible light. If less energy is needed to produce light less fossil fuels will be used. See [http://www2.epa.gov/cfl](http://www2.epa.gov/cfl)  for more information. You should note that fluorescent bulbs should not just be thrown in the ordinary trash.

Q4. Energy can be put into an atom to cause electrons to make transitions to upper energy levels. This may be accomplished by letting the atom absorb light. Energy can also be transferred to an atomic electron through a collision with another atom. If the atom has a metastable state for one of its excited levels, the number of electrons in the upper level can exceed the number of electrons in a lower level. The normal state of an atom is to have more electrons in a lower energy level. When there are more electrons in an upper energy level a population inversion has been achieved.

## 30.6 The Wave Nature of Matter Causes Quantization

### To Do

-
  - Explain Bohr&#39;s model of atom.
  - Define and describe quantization of angular momentum.
  - Define and describe the wave-like properties of matter.

### Notes

You may remember our discussions of standing sound waves in air columns. Suppose a tube contains some water and the water level can be adjusted. If a tuning fork is held over the tube you can hear a louder sound (resonance) when the length of the air column has a certain value. The resonance condition occurs when a standing wave is set up in the air column.

Bohr stated that the electrons were stable (didn&#39;t continuously radiate energy) in their orbits in the hydrogen atom. This can be explained if the circumference of the electron &quot;orbit&quot; is an integer times the electron wavelength. The electron wave in the atom is similar to the standing wave of sound in an air column. (But don&#39;t think the electron wave is reflecting back and forth as happens for the sound.)

According to the diagram in the textbook, what orbits are forbidden?

Q1. TRUE or FALSE  The wavelength of an electron is related to its momentum.

Q2. TRUE or FALSE  If the wavelength of the electron only has certain discrete values then the angular momentum of the electron only has certain discrete values.

 Is the angular momentum of the electron in the hydrogen atom quantized?

L = nh/(2π)      n = 1,2,3,etc.

Quantum Mechanics deals with probabilities for the location of an electron in the space around an atom. Matter waves cannot be constrained to too small a space (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle). The electron distribution around the nucleus is better described as a cloud rather than a definite orbit.

## 30.7 Patterns in Spectra Reveal More Quantization.

### To Do

-
  - State and discuss the Zeeman effect.
  - Define orbital magnetic field.
  - Define orbital angular momentum.
  - Define space quantization.

### Notes

Describe the Zeeman effect.

What experimental evidence shows that energy is quantized when a magnetic field is applied to atoms?

What causes the &quot;doublet&quot; lines in spectra?

## 30.8 Quantum Numbers and Rules

### To Do

-
  - Define quantum number.
  - Define spin quantum number.

### Notes

Read this section of the textbook looking for the main concepts. We will not calculate L or the angles between components of angular momentum.

Quantum Mechanics is a much better description of the nature of the atom than the Bohr theory. Four quantum numbers are needed to describe the state of an electron in the quantum mechanical view of the atom. Describe the interpretation and/or implications for

a) the principal quantum number, n

b) the orbital quantum number l

c) the magnetic quantum number ml

d) the spin quantum number  ms

You must memorize the table shown in Figure 30.56.

## 30.9 The Pauli Exclusion Principle

### To Do

-
  - Define the composition of an atom along with its electrons, neutrons, and protons.
  - Explain the Pauli exclusion principle and its application to the atom.
  - Specify the shell and subshell symbols and their positions.
  - Define the position of electrons in different shells of an atom.
  - State the position of each element in the periodic table according to shell filling.

### Notes

Pauli Exclusion Principle  No two electrons in one atom can have the same 4 quantum numbers.

What questions do you have on Figure 30.59?

What is a shell?                subshell?

Table 30.2 is a little misleading. There can be more than one value for l for a given value of n. It would be better to imagine that shell column in a table separate from the two subshell columns.

Know how to calculate how many electrons can be in one shell or one subshell. The formulas for these calculations will not be given to you for the exam. You need to be able to do the count from your understanding of values of the quantum numbers and the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

What does the atomic number, Z, describe?

How many electrons are in a neutral atom that has 13 protons in its nucleus?

Know how to write an electron configuration for low Z atoms. You do not need to memorize table 30.3 but you should be able to construct it using your understanding of values of the quantum numbers and the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and the principle that the lowest energy states are filled first.

How does the Pauli Exclusion principle help explain the periodic table?

Q3. Does the electron spin like a basketball would spin?

Quantum Mechanics can be used to state the probability that a certain electron transition between states will occur. A selection rule is a general statement that specifies which transitions are likely to occur. One selection rule is that the value of l changes by +1 or -1 when the electron changes energy states.

An allowed transition is an electron transition between states that has a high probability of occurring. l changing by +1 or -1 is characteristic of an allowed transition.

What is a forbidden transition?  Where in the universe have scientists observed forbidden transitions?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

# Ch 31: Radioactivity and Nuclear Physics

## Introduction

The previous chapter was concerned with the electron structure in the atom. The next two chapters discuss the nucleus, radioactivity, and nuclear energy. You will discover that there are two more forces (not gravity and not the electromagnetic force) that are active inside the nucleus.

## Terms to Know

-
  - nuclear radiation, ionization, alpha, beta, gamma, nucleus, Geiger counter, proton, neutron, nucleon, atomic number, isotope, strong nuclear force, nuclear decay, parent, daughter
  - half-life, activity, radioactive dating, binding energy, tunneling
  - Zeeman Effect, Quantum Number, Pauli Exclusion Principle, Shell, Subshell

## 31.1 Nuclear Radioactivity

### To Do

-
  - Explain nuclear radiation.
  - Explain the types of radiation—alpha emission, beta emission, and gamma emission.
  - Explain ionization danger of radiation.
  - Define the range of radiation.

### Notes

Discovery of Nuclear Radioactivity

Did you every have shoes or a toy that would &quot;glow in the dark?&quot;  In the late 1890&#39;s Becquerel was studying how various minerals stored up light energy and released it later (phosphorescence). As part of his experiments he would take photographs of the light from the minerals. On one occasion he stored a photographic plate (chemical emulsion that responds to light, not a CCD camera) in light-tight paper in a dark drawer with a mineral that contained uranium. When he took the photographic plate out of the drawer and used it in an experiment he found that the plate had already been exposed (by the uranium). Becquerel discovered that radiation from some minerals can pass through paper (and thin metals). The study of nuclear radiation began.

In phosphorescence, the mineral has to be exposed to light to move electrons up to metastable states. If the mineral is not re-energized by light it soon does not glow in the dark. The minerals involved in radioactivity do not need to be energized by light.

Define the word &quot;decay&quot; in the context of nuclear physics.

What takes place if a mineral is radioactive?

The light emitted from atoms due to electron transitions changes if the atoms are studied with different temperature, pressure, how many electrons have been removed, and magnetic field. None of these changes affect the nuclear radiations.

Nuclear radiations have energies measured in the millions of electron volts (MeV), while light from atoms due to electron transitions has energy of a few eV.

Q1. TRUE or FALSE  Transitions in electron energy levels create nuclear radiation.

Our current understanding of the atom is that it has a nucleus and has electrons. Since the electrons are not involved with nuclear radiation, the nuclear radiation must originate in the nucleus.

Alpha, Beta, and Gamma

The three common nuclear radiations are alpha, beta, and gamma. As part of the scientific process scientists label observations so they can communicate with other scientists. As the phenomena is better studied the initial label may change. The cathode ray is now called an electron but the alpha, beta, gamma labels continue to be used for nuclear radiation.

How was the charge for the nuclear radiations deduced?

How does the mass of an alpha particle compare to the mass of an electron?

What are the basic characteristics of alpha, beta, and gamma emissions?

                Charge                Type of object

Alpha

Beta

Gamma

Q2, True or False   Before a beta particle (electron) is emitted by the nucleus the electron exists as a separate object in the nucleus.

Ionization and Range

Define the term &quot;ionizing radiation.&quot;

Q3. Why can alpha, beta, and gamma radiations ionize atoms?

As the alpha, beta, or gamma passes through shielding material it loses energy by ionizing atoms.

In your own words, describe why it is reasonable that a nuclear radiation with more energy will have a greater range (thicker shielding material is needed to stop the radiation).

Denser materials are often composed of atoms that have more protons. e.g. Lead is denser than graphite (carbon). If an atom has more protons it will have more electrons (given that it is electrically neutral). If the material has more electrons there is a greater probability that the nuclear radiation will interact with those electrons and lose energy. Denser materials provide greater shielding (given that the two shields have the same thickness). You can use paper as shielding material but you will need a greater thickness than a lead shield.

There is an error in the first edition of the OpenStax textbook regarding the charge on the beta. The charge is -1qe, not -2qe.

For the following section assume the alphas, betas, and gammas have the same energies.

Why does the alpha particle have a shorter range than the beta particle?   Read the whole paragraph before answering. There are two factors that cause the range of the alpha to be smaller.

    1.
    
    2.

Why does the gamma have the largest range?

Write down the range of alphas through the skin \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   through air \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

Write down the range of betas through paper  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   through air \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

Write down the range of gammas through air \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_   through lead \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ .

All of these ranges are approximate. The goal of shielding is to reduce the number of alphas, betas, and gammas to a level comparable with what humans experience from natural sources (cosmic rays, radon gas in the air, radioactive materials in brick, granite, bananas, carbon dioxide, organic molecules, dirt, ….)

## 31.2 Radiation Detection and Detectors

### To Do

-
  - Explain the working principle of a Geiger tube.

### Notes

Write a summary of how the Geiger tube detects nuclear radiation.

The Geiger counter does not provide detailed information on the radiation. A count can be created by an alpha, or beta, or gamma. The Geiger counter does not give information on the energy of the nuclear radiation.

The scintillator is better at detecting gamma and beta radiation than the Geiger counter and can provide information on the energy of the radiation.

Semiconductors (computer chips, transistors) can be used to detect beta and gamma radiation and provide information on the energy of the radiation.

## 31.3 Substructure of the Nucleus

### To Do

-
  - Define and discuss the nucleus in an atom.
  - Define atomic number.
  - Define and discuss isotopes.
  - Calculate the size and density of the nucleus.
  - Explain nuclear force.

### Notes

To understand nuclear radiation we need to better understand the nucleus.

Describe the net charge on the proton and neutron and compare their mass values.

 proton                                                  neutron

Describe when and how the proton was identified.

Where would you find a nucleon and what could it be?

Why is the atomic mass unit, u, more convenient to use in this chapter than kg?

What is the standard for u?

You should memorize that Z is the atomic number, the number of protons for a nucleus.

You should memorize that A is the atomic mass number, the sum of the count of protons and neutrons.

What is N?     N = A - Z

How does one isotope of an element differ from another isotope?

Each isotope has a &quot;natural abundance.&quot;  How would that be determined?

What procedure allows an estimate of the radius of a nucleus to be determined?

r = 1.2 x 10-15 A 1/3         We will treat the nucleus to be a sphere.

Density = mass / volume

Why are nuclei so much more dense than water (1000 kg/m3)?

Nuclear Forces and Stability

In the carbon-12 nucleus there are 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Are the protons close to each other?  Is there a large electrical repelling force between the protons. Do you think the carbon-12 nuclei and atoms in your body are stable or radioactive?   Why do the protons stay close to each other in the nucleus?

The details of the behavior of the strong nuclear force are still being investigated. It is about 100 times larger than the electromagnetic force but the strong force has a value of zero of the nucleons are separated by more than about 3 x 10-15 meters. The nuclear force is a &quot;short range&quot; force while the electromagnetic force and gravity are &quot;long range.&quot;  For the nuclear force, protons attract protons, protons attract neutrons, and neutrons attract neutrons.

The strong nuclear force is associated with alpha decay. The weak nuclear force is associated with beta decay. Gamma decay occurs when a proton or neutron makes a transition in an energy level in the nucleus.

We used equations for the force of gravity and for the electric and magnetic forces. Why does the text not show the equation that allows for a calculation of the strength of the strong nuclear force for various nuclei?

The energies of the nuclear radiations are larger than the energy of light from electron transitions because the force is stronger, and some significant (but very small kg) mass is converted to energy in the nuclear processes.

Why does the number of neutrons exceed the number of protons for stable nuclei as Z increases?

## 31.4 Nuclear Decay and Conservation Laws

### To Do

-
  - Define and discuss nuclear decay.
  - State the conservation laws and balance nuclear reactions
  - Explain parent and daughter nucleus.
  - Calculate the energy emitted during nuclear decay.

### Notes

For nuclear decay, define parent.

For nuclear decay, define daughter.

What is a decay series?

How do the Z and A numbers change for a nucleus when alpha decay occurs?

What are the two conservation laws for nuclear decay?

ENERGY

You should be able to calculate the energy release for alpha and beta decay.

energy     = (MParent - Mdaughter - Mother)c2

For alpha decay you need to use the parent, daughter, and alpha particle masses.

Steps to find the energy of the decay:

Look up the masses of the neutral atoms in atomic mass units.

Subtract to find the mass (in u&#39;s) that became energy.

Use the conversion factor 931.5 MeV / u  to compute the energy.

        You do not need to use 3 x 108 if you use atomic mass units instead of kg for the masses.

Note: Momentum is conserved in the decay. The object with the smallest mass carries off most of the kinetic energy.

Beta Decay

How do the Z and A numbers change for a nucleus when beta decay occurs?

Why was the neutrino hypothesized to exist?   What are its characteristics?

Describe when the neutrino was hypothesized to exist and when it was actually detected in an experiment.

For beta decay you just need to use the parent and daughter masses. The beta particle mass is included in the mass of the neutral daughter atom. The beta decay process involves a neutron decaying to a proton and electron inside the nucleus. When the beta decay occurs the daughter will have one less electron than the number of protons. The mass of the neutrino is near zero so we will not bother in using its mass in the calculations.

Gamma Decay

How do the Z and A numbers change for a nucleus when gamma decay occurs?

Do you agree with the textbook that this is the simplest form of nuclear decay?

What does the asterisk by the chemical symbol signify?

Be sure to work through the examples in the textbook on alpha, beta, and gamma decay.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. False   The nuclear radiations have much different properties than light emitted when an electron makes a transition to a different energy level.

Q2. False   The electron is created as a part of the nuclear decay and ejected from the nucleus. Also, the beta particle is not one of the atomic electrons that surround the nucleus.

Q3. These radiations carry MeVs of energy but only a few eVs are needed to remove an electron from an atom.

## 31.5 Half-Life and Activity

### To Do

-
  - Define half-life.
  - Define dating.
  - Calculate age of old objects by radioactive dating.

### Notes

Suppose the popcorn bag in a microwave was transparent and you were watching one particular kernel of the popcorn.

Q1. TRUE or FALSE  It is possible to predict when one kernel of popcorn will pop.

Q2. TRUE or FALSE  For a given type of popcorn it is possible to predict when half of the kernels of popcorn will pop.

Q3. TRUE or FALSE  It is possible to predict when one radioactive nucleus will decay.

Q4. TRUE or FALSE  It is possible to predict when one-half of the radioactive nuclei of a particular isotope will have decayed.

In your own words define half-life.

Q5. TRUE or FALSE   In a time equal to one half-life, one half of the mass of the system disappears.

What is the specific name of the shape of the curve in Figure 31.21?

Unfortunately the symbol N has two meanings in this one chapter. In the context of protons an neutrons N is the count of neutrons. In the context of half-life N is the number of nuclei.

As radioactive decay occurs the number of original radioactive nuclei in the sample will decrease. Let this be represented by N. In the context of half-life  is the symbol for the decay constant.

N =   -  N t         t is the time interval during which N nuclei decayed.

Why is the number of nuclei that decay, N, proportional to N?

Using Calculus the law of radioactive decay can be derived: N = No e-t           No is the number of the original radioactive nuclei at the start of the time interval. N is the number of the original radioactive nuclei that remain after the time interval. t is the time interval.

Be able to solve problems that use N = No e-t

Decay Series

Radon-222 has a half-life of 3.8 days. Suppose the earth formed 4.5 billion years ago with a certain amount of Radon-222 in its crust. Would much of this original Radon exist today?  Why?

Why is Radon-222 detectable in our environment today?

Which isotopes in the decay chain will have the greatest abundance?

RADIOACTIVE DATING

What is the goal of radioactive dating?

Q6. What are the assumptions for carbon-14 dating?   (Don&#39;t skip the answer given at the end of this reading guide.)

Why is dating with Carbon-14 limited to about the past 60,000 years?

What isotope would be useful in finding the age of the Earth through radioactive dating?

We may do examples of radioactive dating.

Activity, the Rate of Decay

Activity  =  N       The symbol R is used for the activity. R =  N     = 0.693 / T ½

Or, R = 0.693 N / T ½

        Units of activity:        1 Becquerel = 1 decay / 1 second
    
                                1 Curie = 3.7 x 1010 decays per second

We may do examples of activity calculations.

Why does the activity number increase when the half-life value decreases?

Suppose you are holding (YOU WON&quot;T DO THIS) a radioactive isotope in your left hand and a different radioactive isotope in your right hand. They both emit gamma rays. What two pieces of information do you need to decide which is more dangerous?

## 31.6 Binding Energy

### To Do

-
  - Define and discuss binding energy.
  - Calculate the binding energy per nucleon of a nucleus.

### Notes

The mass of a stable nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its separate nucleons. You can calculate the &quot;binding energy&quot; of a nucleus by calculating the difference in mass in kg and using E=mc2 . But, using the atomic mass unit and a conversion 931.5 MeV / u   provides an equivalent and easier method.

In order to ionize an atom the electron must be given energy. In order to &quot;ionize&quot; a nucleus, to separate the nucleons of a stable nucleus, is energy required?

Know how to calculate the total and average binding energy. A table of atomic masses will be given at the exam for various isotopes.

What is notable about Fe-56 in Figure 31.27?

Note:  The textbook has an error in 4) of the problem solving strategies. The constant in the equation is 0.693, not 1.693.

## 31.7 Tunneling

### To Do

-
  - Define and discuss tunneling.
  - Define potential barrier.
  - Explain quantum tunneling.

### Notes

Alpha decay:  One model of large nuclei is that alpha particles are likely to exist as objects in these large nuclei. The don&#39;t easily escape because they don&#39;t possess enough energy to break free of the nucleus, as shown in Figure 31.31. In order for the alpha particle to escape when its energy is less than the maximum PE caused by the nuclear force, the alpha particle has to have negative KE when it is at a distance where the PE is a maximum.(Figure 31.31).

Q7. How is it possible that the alpha particle has a negative KE during the alpha decay process?

The probability nature of quantum mechanics allows the alpha particle to be found outside the nucleus. After this occurs the positive nucleus repels the positive alpha particle.

What is &quot;tunneling&quot; in the context of alpha decay?

CHAPTER 31 MISCELLANEOUS

All isotopes with Z \&gt; 83 are radioactive.

Two elements with Z \&lt;= 83 have no stable isotopes.

There are about 280 stable isotopes and \&gt; 800 radioactive isotopes.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. False   This is a random event.

Q2. True  Statistically, one half of the kernels will pop in about a certain time. This lets the manufacturer put a label on the bag of popcorn that states how many minutes it should cook in the microwave.

Q3. False   This is a random event

Q4. True  Statistically, one half of the nuclei will decay in a time that depends on what isotope is being studied.

Q5. False   In a radioactive decay, little mass disappears. Most of the mass (protons, neutrons, electrons) is still present but the isotopes will be different after the decay.

Q6. C-14 is produced in our upper atmosphere when a neutron produced by the collision of a cosmic ray and an atom in the upper atmosphere merges with nitrogen-14. Shortly after the merger a proton from the nitrogen is ejected and the nucleus becomes a carbon nucleus with 8 protons. I am 99.9999% certain our textbook has an error when it states that solar neutrinos are responsible for producing carbon-14. In order to use carbon-14 for radioactive dating it is assumed that the equilibrium amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere in the past is the same as the current amount of carbon-14 in our atmosphere. Carbon-14 dating has been verified back to about 8,000 BC by using overlapping data from tree ring counts.

Q7. Recall the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for Energy and Time

ΔE Δt = h/(4 π )    For a short time the uncertainty in the energy allows the KE to be negative.

## 30.6 The Wave Nature of Matter Causes Quantization

### To Do

-
  - Explain Bohr&#39;s model of atom.
  - Define and describe quantization of angular momentum.
  - Define and describe the wave-like properties of matter.

### Notes

You may remember our discussions of standing sound waves in air columns. Suppose a tube contains some water and the water level can be adjusted. If a tuning fork is held over the tube you can hear a louder sound (resonance) when the length of the air column has a certain value. The resonance condition occurs when a standing wave is set up in the air column.

Bohr stated that the electrons were stable (didn&#39;t continuously radiate energy) in their orbits in the hydrogen atom. This can be explained if the circumference of the electron &quot;orbit&quot; is an integer times the electron wavelength. The electron wave in the atom is similar to the standing wave of sound in an air column. (But don&#39;t think the electron wave is reflecting back and forth as happens for the sound.)

According to the diagram in the textbook, what orbits are forbidden?

Q1. TRUE or FALSE  The wavelength of an electron is related to its momentum.

Q2. TRUE or FALSE  If the wavelength of the electron only has certain discrete values then the angular momentum of the electron only has certain discrete values.

 Is the angular momentum of the electron in the hydrogen atom quantized?

L = nh/(2π)      n = 1,2,3,etc.

Quantum Mechanics deals with probabilities for the location of an electron in the space around an atom. Matter waves cannot be constrained to too small a space (Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle). The electron distribution around the nucleus is better described as a cloud rather than a definite orbit.

## 30.7 Patterns in Spectra Reveal More Quantization.

### To Do

-
  - State and discuss the Zeeman effect.
  - Define orbital magnetic field.
  - Define orbital angular momentum.
  - Define space quantization.

### Notes

Describe the Zeeman effect.

What experimental evidence shows that energy is quantized when a magnetic field is applied to atoms?

What causes the &quot;doublet&quot; lines in spectra?

## 30.8 Quantum Numbers and Rules

### To Do

-
  - Define quantum number.
  - Define spin quantum number.

### Notes

Read this section of the textbook looking for the main concepts. We will not calculate L or the angles between components of angular momentum.

Quantum Mechanics is a much better description of the nature of the atom than the Bohr theory. Four quantum numbers are needed to describe the state of an electron in the quantum mechanical view of the atom. Describe the interpretation and/or implications for

a) the principal quantum number, n

b) the orbital quantum number l

c) the magnetic quantum number ml

d) the spin quantum number  ms

You must memorize the table shown in Figure 30.56.

## 30.9 The Pauli Exclusion Principle

### To Do

-
  - Define the composition of an atom along with its electrons, neutrons, and protons.
  - Explain the Pauli exclusion principle and its application to the atom.
  - Specify the shell and subshell symbols and their positions.
  - Define the position of electrons in different shells of an atom.
  - State the position of each element in the periodic table according to shell filling.

### Notes

Pauli Exclusion Principle  No two electrons in one atom can have the same 4 quantum numbers.

What questions do you have on Figure 30.59?

What is a shell?                subshell?

Table 30.2 is a little misleading. There can be more than one value for l for a given value of n. It would be better to imagine that shell column in a table separate from the two subshell columns.

Know how to calculate how many electrons can be in one shell or one subshell. The formulas for these calculations will not be given to you for the exam. You need to be able to do the count from your understanding of values of the quantum numbers and the Pauli Exclusion Principle.

What does the atomic number, Z, describe?

How many electrons are in a neutral atom that has 13 protons in its nucleus?

Know how to write an electron configuration for low Z atoms. You do not need to memorize table 30.3 but you should be able to construct it using your understanding of values of the quantum numbers and the Pauli Exclusion Principle, and the principle that the lowest energy states are filled first.

How does the Pauli Exclusion principle help explain the periodic table?

Q3. Does the electron spin like a basketball would spin?

Quantum Mechanics can be used to state the probability that a certain electron transition between states will occur. A selection rule is a general statement that specifies which transitions are likely to occur. One selection rule is that the value of l changes by +1 or -1 when the electron changes energy states.

An allowed transition is an electron transition between states that has a high probability of occurring. l changing by +1 or -1 is characteristic of an allowed transition.

What is a forbidden transition?  Where in the universe have scientists observed forbidden transitions?

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. True    λ = h/p

Q2. True

Q3. No, but it has a property equivalent to spin.

# Ch 32: Medical Applications of Nuclear Physics

## Introduction

Write down two beneficial applications of knowledge of the nucleus that you are aware of.

Write down two adverse effects or applications of nuclear effects that you are aware of.

## Terms to Know

-
  - Radiopharmaceuticals, tagged, tracer, PET, rad, Gray, RBE, rem, Sievert, irradiation, fusion, magnetic confinement, Tokamak, inertial confinement, break-even
  - fission, enrichment, fuel rod, moderator, control rod, chain reaction, cooling loop, heat exchanger,

## 32.1 Medical Imaging and Diagnostics

### To Do

-
  - Explain the working principle behind radiopharmaceuticals.
  - Describe the PET imaging techniques.

### Notes

Carbon-14 is chemically identical to carbon-12. Other radioactive isotopes are chemically equivalent to the non-radioactive isotope of the same element. Medical researchers have deduced which elements or molecules tend to concentrate in certain organs or regions of the body due to different medical conditions. Radiopharmaceuticals take advantage of this by delivering the radioactive isotope in a biologically targeted molecule to certain locations in the body. The radiopharmaceutical is tagged by placing a radioactive isotope in the compound.

Another term for radiopharmaceutical would be tracer. Tracer is a little broader term as it applies to studies of plants as well as humans (or animals).

Q1. How is the location of the radiopharmaceutical determined when it is in the body?

Q2. Would it be good practice to use an alpha emitter in a radiopharmaceutical that is used to locate an organ or diagnose a condition in the body?

Would you recommend tagging the compound with a short half-life isotope or long half-life isotope?

Medical Application

You should scan through the table (32.1) but you will not be held accountable for knowing these facts.

When a tracer is used that emits positrons, what is detected to locate the radiopharmaceutical?

## 32.2 Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation

### To Do

-
  - Describe the danger of radiation to cells.
  - Describe RBE. And calculate rad and rem.

### Notes

Q3. How does radiation damage a cell?

What is your reaction to this statement in the textbook: &quot;we can have as many as a million individual instances of damage to DNA per cell per day?&quot; College Physics, Open Stax College (2012) page 1155

Why does ionizing radiation preferentially kill cancer cells over healthy cells?

MEASUREMENTS OF EXPOSURE

Since the number of ionizations is related to the energy absorbed a useful measurement of exposure is the radiation dose unit (rad). 1 rad = 0.01 Joule/kg

Calculate the number of rads if 0.0004 Joules are absorbed throughout the body by a person who has a mass of 80 kg.

The rad is a traditional unit. The metric standard unit of dose is the gray (Gy). 1 Gray = 1 Joule/kg.

Convert 0.25 rads to Grays.

Different nuclear radiations have different stopping distances and thus can deposit energy in few cells or many cells. If the energy is deposited in fewer cells it is less likely that the cell will be able to repair itself. Also, neutrons can easily be absorbed by the nucleus and make the nucleus in the atom in the cell radioactive. The varying dangers of the radiations are summarized with a factor called the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). This is also known as the quality factor. (&quot;Quality&quot; has a little of a reverse meaning however as a higher quality factor indicates more danger to a human.)

You should know why certain radiations have a value of RBE greater than 1.

The roentgen equivalent man, rem, is calculated by      rem = rad \* RBE   .

The metric version of this is the Sievert (Sv)        Sv = Grays \* RBE   .

Prof. Clements uses rad and rem in these calculations but you should be aware the metric terms exist.

Q4. What are some background radiation sources?

Radiation Protection

How can you lower the dose you receive from a radioactive source?  3 ways

1.                        2.                                3.

Look at Figure 32.10. What is the purpose of the lead collimator on the X-ray machine?

Do you feel that the benefits of medical imaging (radiopharmaceuticals, x-ray, etc.) outweigh the risks?

The graph of binding energy per nucleon vs. atomic mass is important for understanding the release of nuclear energy by both fusion and fission. Iron-56 has the largest binding energy per nucleon. As a consequence iron will not release energy when it is involved in fusion or fission. A fusion reaction that releases energy involves elements with Z \&lt; 26 that create a product that is closer to the peak of this curve than the location of the elements that are fusing. A fission reaction that releases energy involves a heavy element Z  around 90 that creates products that are closer to the peak of the curve than the location of the original element.

When did astronomers understand that nuclear reactions were the ultimate source of the energy emitted by the Sun?

Q5. What is fusion in the context of nuclear reactions?

Nuclei carry positive charge. The nuclear force only becomes active when nuclei are very close, e.g. within 2 x 10-15 meters. Atoms in our air are colliding continuously. Why doesn&#39;t fusion occur when atoms in our air collide?

Consider two nuclei that do not have any associated electrons. Why is it difficult for them to approach each other to a distance smaller than 2 x 10-15 meters?

Two nuclei can approach to a small distance if the kinetic energy of the nuclei is close to the potential energy caused by the repelling electrical charges. A high value of KE is created by high speed. High speeds can be produced by creating a high temperature for a collection of nuclei.

Q6. Why don&#39;t the nuclei have to touch in order that they fuse?

You should know the net reaction for the proton-proton cycle:

2_e_− + 41H → 4He + 2νe + 6γ    26.7 MeV released   .

Are the number of nucleons and the charge conserved in this reaction?

Q7. The isotope 2H is called deuterium. Why is it easier to cause two deuterium nuclei to fuse than to cuase two protons to fuse?

Scientists are trying to develop the production of electricity through fusion reactions. There is much more fuel, deuterium, that there is fuel for fission reactors, uranium, that are currently used to produce electrical power. And, there is much less radioactive waste for fusion compared to fission.

Q8. In order to have significant fusion energy released, what are two requirements for the state of the deuterium nuclei?

The temperature for fusion is on the order of several million Kelvin.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium\_burning

At the fusion temperature the atoms are ionized. This ionized material is called plasma (completely different than blood plasma).

Q9. Why can&#39;t solid walls be used to hold the plasma?

Why does a magnetic field apply a force to the plasma?

Q10. What is magnetic confinement?

Q11. What is the advantage of the shape of the Tokamak?

Describe the concept of fusion through inertial confinement.

Laboratories have achieved production of power from fusion that matches the power used to heat the plasma and confine the plasma with the magnetic field. This is known as &quot;break-even.&quot;   Much, much, more work needs to be done to make commercial sized fusion reactors (could Tony Stark help???). 50 years ago some scientists predicted that the world would be using fusion power for electrical energy. Some would say that our textbook&#39;s prediction of 20 to 30 years until fusion power is a reality for society is optimistic.

OPTIONAL:  If you want to know the basics of the life cycles of stars stop by my office. The temperature dependence of fusion and the high binding energy per nucleon for iron play major roles in the life of a star.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. Small detectors outside the body would be used to look for nuclear emissions. Small detectors allow a better determination of the location of the concentration of the pharmaceutical. A single large detector would not give enough detail about the location.

Q2. An alpha emitter would be a very bad idea if this is not a treatment. The alphas would be emitted inside the body and do damage to cells, but since the alphas have a very short range, none of the alphas would be able to escape from the person and be detected. If the purpose is to treat a local region in the body then the alpha emitter would be a good choice as it would irradiate the region where the radiopharmaceutical concentrates and not irradiate the whole body.

Q3. The nuclear radiations have more than enough energy to ionize atoms. When the atom is ionized it no longer has the same chemical behavior and the molecule that contains the atom no longer has its proper function.

Q4. Sources of background radiation: radioactive isotopes in soil, rock, brick, concrete, granite; radon gas in the air; cosmic rays; food that contains potassium (but don&#39;t give up your intake of potassium), food that contains carbon;

Q5. Fusion occurs when two nuclei merge to form a larger nucleus.

Q6. Fusion is somewhat the reverse of alpha decay (tunneling). Quantum Mechanics predicts that fusion can occur by the particles tunneling through the potential barrier. The probability that fusion takes place goes up as the temperature goes up as the particles will get closer together and the particles will have a KE that is closer to the PE height of the barrier (Figure 32.17).

Q7. The deuterium has a neutron. This neutron contributes to the KE of the deuterium but does not cause additional repelling force.

Q8  A high temperature is needed so the nuclei get reasonably close and fuse. A high density is needed so there are many fusion reactions per second.

Q9. All known materials melt at temperatures much, much less than a million Kelvin. Also, if walls could be found that did not melt, those walls would experience a temperature rise that would take away KE from the plasma.

.

Q10. The density of the plasma can be maintained by using a strong magnetic field to apply a force that concentrates and holds the plasma within a small volume.

Q11. The Tokamak is a donought shaped device. The magnetic bottle being used to hold the plasma has no end for plasma to leak out. Compared to a linear magnetic bottle, the Tokamak can more easily achieve the needed density of deuterium plasma for fusion power.

## 32.6 Fission

### To Do

-
  - Define nuclear fission.
  - Discuss how fission produces a chain reaction in a nuclear power plant.
  - Describe controlled chain reactions.

### Notes

What takes place when fission occurs?

Fission came to be understood in the late 1930&#39;s and was controlled in the early 1940&#39;s.

Describe the importance of fission nuclear power plants to the world as described in the textbook.

Fission of large nuclei releases energy because the products are closer to the peak of the binding energy curve than the original large nucleus. About how much energy is released per fission? \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ MeV

Even though about 10 times more energy is released for one fission than for one fusion, the energy released per kilogram is greater for fusion since hydrogen is much less massive than uranium.

When you work energy calculations for fission you will be told which isotopes are involved.

Q1. Why is the uranium ore dug out of the ground not put directly into fuel rods for a fission reactor?

Q2. What is enrichment?

Q3. How is enrichment performed?

Why might the probability that a nucleus will capture slow neutrons be larger than the probability of capturing a fast neutron?

Fission releases a large amount of energy. Are the neutrons released by fission fast or slow?

What is the purpose of a moderator?

Q4. What are the characteristics of a good moderator?

Heavy water is a moderator used in some reactor designs. Heavy water uses deuterium as the hydrogen atom in the water molecule.

In a chain reaction, neutrons from one fission cause fissions in other uranium-235 nuclei. The number of fissions will grow exponentially if slow neutrons and enough uranium-235 nuclei are available per cubic meter. A nuclear power plant cannot have a nuclear explosion because the uranium is not enriched enough (there are not enough uranium-235 targets). But there is a chain reaction in the reactor and the energy output needs to be controlled to avoid damage from high temperature and pressure in the nuclear plant. To limit the rate of fissions, some of the neutrons released by the fissions need to be absorbed. The control rods of the nuclear reactor absorb neutrons. When the control rods are inserted in between the rods that hold the uranium fuel the number of fissions is reduced (but not reduced to zero).

Fission releases energy so the temperature increases in the uranium fuel rods. The primary coolant loop transports this energy to the heat exchanger to keep the fuel rods from melting. In the heat exchanger, energy moves from the primary coolant loop to the secondary coolant loop and steam is created. This steam drives the blades of turbines that generate electricity using the principle of Faraday&#39;s Law.

There are many more neutrons than protons in uranium-235. Suppose the fission produces two nuclei that have roughly equal masses. These nuclei are much lower in the periodic table than uranium. Recall the graph of the number of neutrons vs. number of protons. This graph had a solid pink section that showed the stable nuclei. Why are fission fragments radioactive?

Uranium-235 is not an abundant isotope of uranium. It is possible to produce fissionable plutonium from a non-fissionable isotope of uranium. A breeder reactor produces plutonium, and produces more fissionable fuel than it consumes. Optional: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder\_reactor

Q5. What is done with the radioactive fission products when a fuel rod reaches the end of its useful life?

FOSSIL FUELS

Coal and oil fired electrical generating plants are not without problems. Large quantities of the fuel have to be mined or pumped from the ground. The fuel has to be transported. Greenhouse gases and particle pollutants are released when the fuel is burned. And, radioactive isotopes in coal are released into the air.

## 32.7 Nuclear Weapons

### To Do

-
  - Be aware why nuclear weapons were developed.
  - Explain the ill effects of nuclear explosion.

### Notes

Describe how the Three Mile Island accident occurred and what the effects were.

Describe how the Chernobyl accident occurred and what the effects were.

Research on fission was done during World War II. The first nuclear reactor was secretly built in Chicago in 1942. This seems a little bold to me but the physicists believed they understood the fission process and could control the rate of fissions. Optional: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan\_Project

What environmental impact occurs from a nuclear bomb?

THREE MILE ISLAND  March 1979

Prof. Clements was teaching at Dickinson College (about 20 miles from Three Mile Island) when the accident occurred. A faculty member at Dickinson lived about one mile from Three Mile Island.

If possible you should watch an excellent documentary: Meltdown at Three Mile Island.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAmW8wkHNv4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAmW8wkHNv4)

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/three/

After you watch the video about Three Mile Island you should be able to answer these questions:

Where is Three Mile Island located?

What caused the accident?

What limited the knowledge of the plant operators as the accident progressed?

How did human intervention make the accident worse?

Why was there a concern about the hydrogen bubble? (2 reasons)

Did the reactor vessel melt?

Was the concrete containment wall cracked?

Did radiation leak into the air outside the plant?

Optional:  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/three//filmmore/description.html

Optional:   http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/nuclear-accident-at-three-mile-island

CHERNOBYL  April 1986

Chernobyl is located in Ukraine. Human error led to a power surge in the core of the reactor. This surge of power caused an explosion that breached the containment and started a fire in the graphite (carbon) moderator. This fire carried radioactive isotopes high into the atmosphere. Winds carried the radioactive isotopes to other countries. At least 31 firefighters and plant personnel were killed in the first days from radiation exposure. The radiation released has caused cancers in those who were exposed to heavy amounts of fallout. Land for about 20 miles radius around Chernobyl was evacuated and remains uninhabitable.

Transmutation of Elements

Would you like to have more pure gold in your possession? Is it possible to change one element into another element via a chemical reaction?   Alchemists tried to do this, unsuccessfully, hundreds of years ago.

During a nuclear reaction protons or neutrons or nuclei combine with other nuclei. In a transmutation the initial nucleus is changed into another nucleus (often another element). If the mass of the products is greater than the mass of the reactants the nuclear reaction requires some kinetic energy on the reactant side of the process. Positively charged objects are repelled by the nucleus and have difficulty getting close enough to the nucleus to merge with the nucleus. Neutrons are not repelled and are effective projectiles for causing nuclear reactions.

Nuclear reactions can change some starting element into gold. However, the cost of the process far exceeds the value of the gold that is produced.

ANSWERS   ……………………..

Q1. You should know that certain isotopes fission more easily than other isotopes. Uranium-235 fissions easily but has a low abundance.

Q2. In order to produce fuel for nuclear reactors the density of uranium-235 has to be increased. Enrichment raises the number of uranium-235 isotopes in the uranium material. You may have heard news reports about enrichment projects in various countries that are causing concern for the United States since those countries are not on friendly terms with the United States.

Q3. The isotopes have different masses. The book  briefly discusses the most popular separation method. You only need to know that the separation is accomplished based on the mass difference.

Q4. The moderator should slow the neutrons but not absorb the neutrons.

Q5. Each nuclear reactor stores spent fuel rods in a pool of water at the site of the nuclear reactor. The USA does not have a site for long term storage of spent fuel rods.
